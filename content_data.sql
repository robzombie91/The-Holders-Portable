At first it will be barely audible, as if originating from a point a great distance away, but as you approach the end of the hallway, the screams will grow clearer and more thunderous, until they drone so loudly as to consume all other noises. The din will quickly become so painful that you will feel the unrelenting urge to claw at your own ears to escape it; resist this impulse. The worker, stoically enduring the cacophony, will show you a door. As swiftly as they can, they will unlock it and run, leaving you alone in this cramped, dark hallway.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This will be your last chance to run. If you decide to continue, open the door; the piercing wail will then end abruptly, leaving your ears ringing. The room you will enter will be coated in an almost tangible darkness that consumes all but the far wall. Manacled to that wall is an emaciated figure covered in raw lashes. He will stare directly at you with a maniacal grin plastered to his face, seemingly undisturbed by his festering wounds and the scalpel rammed into his chest. The only way to save yourself from this man\'s dark designs is to ask \"Who created them\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will cackle in a manner befitting the death throes of an animal before responding His will be the most horrific tale you have ever heard beyond such primitive concepts as pain and death It will delve deep into the very essence of evil those of weak mind would go mad hearing it\r\n<br>\r\n<br>When he finishes it will be up to you to release this man from his terrible burden Remove the scalpel and he will shudder once in agony before falling silent forever\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That scalpel is Object 3 of 538 It is up to you if the rest should be protected or destroyed <br><br>'),

Inside will be a seemingly endless corridor that far exceeds the length of that outhouse.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The corridor will be completely silent. Attempting to make any sound at the wrong time is a grievous, lamentable mistake. You will notice the lights in the corridor getting brighter and brighter as you make your way down towards the end; eventually, you will find yourself blinded by their brilliance. If, at any point the lights go out, quickly shout out, \"No! Stop! What you are doing is wrong!\" while backing away. If the lights do not come back on, bolt for the door you came in through. It should still be open; hopefully you aren\'t far enough down the hallway for it to close on you If it does close an eternity in Hell would be preferable to what you will suffer\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the lights come back on continue walking down the corridor At the end of the hall lies a cell the worker will open its door for you while glaring at you in disgust Inside the cell will be a mad pastiche of colors arranged in several harlequinlike formations You must not be distracted by them for at the center of the room is a naked young woman slathered in blood and bound by strips of human sinew and you would be better off not knowing what will happen if you take your eyes off of her face for even a moment Focus on her and ask \"What were they when they were one\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>She will look you in the eye and speak the answer in incredible detail It will be unlike anything you have ever heard leaving you on the verge of both ecstasy and agony It is not uncommon for a Seeker to lose themselves in the euphoria But you mustn\'t let your focus break, and you must take special care not to look upon her tattooed chest. Your mind will tempt you to gaze upon it, but you must resist, for if you fail, she will flay you alive and add your mutilated flesh to her bindings, and you will remain trapped with her, fully conscious, for the rest of time.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That tattoo is Object 4 of 538.

(6, 'The Holder of Song', 'In any city in any country go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to When you reach the front desk ask to visit someone who calls herself \"The Holder of Song You will then be guided to a long staircase that spirals higher than the building stands At the stairs\' summit is a door.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you open the door, a sudden wave of heat will pour out from the hallway beyond it, and wash over you. Proceed down the hallway. As you walk, the air around you will grow increasingly frigid. When you feel as if you are encased in ice, you must stand perfectly still, remain silent, and listen. If, after a few seconds pass, you hear a baby crying, turn and run. No harm will befall you, but the infant\'s cry will follow you wherever you go If you hear it for the rest of your life count yourself lucky if and when it stops your firstborn child will die\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you do not hear a baby\'s cry, wait for the hallway to grow warm once more, and then proceed to the door at its end. Enter.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The room beyond will be awash in green light. At its center will be an old woman turning the handle of a silent music box. Her legs have both been severed at the knees. When you speak to her, you must look her in the eyes. She hides a spear fashioned from the bones of her legs; break eye contact, and she will impale you with it and leave you to bleed to death in seemingly unending agony. She will respond to only one question: \"What was the song they used to play?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The old woman will begin to sing in a language not of this world. Her melody will be the most beautiful one you have ever heard, bringing peace and serenity to your mind, body, and soul. You will find yourself vividly imagining a band of carefree children playing and singing, innocent as can be... And within minutes, the scene will eventually take a horribly sinister turn. The children will begin to fight each other, and their conflict will quickly escalate to the most brutal, lethal violence you can conceive of. They will impale each other on wooden poles, disembowel each other with sharp rocks, and even rip flesh from bone with their bare hands. You will witness these children, now merely tattered doppelgangers of themselves, spreading death and destruction more horrific than you could ever imagine on your own. You will see a naked boy, drenched in blood, singing with delight as he runs through a hellish wasteland, pursued by unspeakable monsters. They will overtake him and utterly destroy him, the song still issuing forth from his shredded lips all the while.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>...Yet, inexplicably, you will remain calm and peaceful even as you watch this unspeakable brutality.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>When these horrific visions end, an intense pain will stab at your chest. Your heart will feel like it is about to explode. Do not let the agony break your focus, and do not break eye contact with the old woman, lest you invite a fate so horrible that an exploding heart seems lovely by comparison. If you remain steadfast in your gaze, the pain will eventually cease. The woman will stand up (though, with your eyes still focused on hers, you will know not how) and place the music box in your hands.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The music box is Object 6 of 538.

As long as you don\'t touch anything you will be safe Don\'t panic.

His suit is made of both human flesh and Italian silk. He may speak, and at great length. He will talk about his amazingly beautiful house and the lovely statue of his concubine resting downstairs. Do not interrupt him, and do not answer any questions he may ask. When he is finished, steel yourself and confidently ask, \"May I have my salary?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will proceed to explain to you, in great detail, the value of life.

Each will wear one glove and hold out both their hands to you.  Take only the gloved hand of each, for should you touch the black-clothed boy\'s flesh you will be plagued with the worst agony in all the universe but you will not die and he will not let go Should you touch the whiteclothed boy\'s flesh, you will feel more pleasure than you have ever experienced, but he will soon pull his hand away, and you will never feel that pleasure again, no matter how you yearn for it; your lust will kill you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The boys will look at each other and nod once; should they shake their heads, close your eyes and quickly say, \"I am not what you seek, but I can change the tides.\"  Once you say this, they will both giggle and pull on your hands, opening a trap door in their cell and descending into darkness.

If she should smile at you, you have amused her, and she will light up the entire room with her light and you will become one of the writhing bodies that makes up the collection beneath her glass floor.

They are to be your judges.  You must the pick the one that you feel will do you justice and walk towards them, asking along your way, \"When will they strip you of this earth?\"  Should you choose the wrong color, the one you have chosen will stand very still and smile at you eerily, and you will soon feel yourself slipping away into nothingness.

You must stab the end of your forefinger with it. You will feel unbearable pain in your finger, but be pleased that I have lessened the pain for you, otherwise you would have had pain throughout your body. You must bear the pain however, and though the blood will not clot the finger, you will not run out of blood, for you are in my realm. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After which, you must draw me a pentagram, 6 feet circumference, with the tip of the star pointing me. Make sure it is good, I am a ruthless judge. (You are allowed to plan and measure.) \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When you are done, I shall look upon it. One of two things will happen. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>One: I turn and close my eyes in disgust; if this happens, the pentagram will catch ablaze. As your blood on the ground burns, so shall the remaining blood in your body. Your veins shall burn for all eternity, in the center of the pentagram, the pain never leaving. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Two: I like your art, and Smile. I will turn to you and Smile. My eyes will blacken, dark, shadowy tendrils will come from my mouth, and form a hellish grin. You will realise that the same is happening to you, and that I have just infected you with my Disease. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When the blackening will cease to flow from your body, it will have turned night; stare only at the pentagram. A demonic audience is watching you, and they tend to rip people to shreds if they look at them, so keep your gaze fixed upon the pentagram. They will dance around you in a devilish flurry, taunting you, mocking you, spitting on you and the like. If you remain stoic, then they will leave. After they have all left, the blackening will return, and ignite a random number of candles around the pentagram. Count and remember this number; it will serve you well at The End. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The light will return and you will awaken outside of the morgue, around mid-day. The cut on your finger will have healed, and it will the exact number of candles that will dictate how many days have gone by.

You now hold the power to summon the Blackening within you at will, the same you saw in my face during the third test. The ones who gaze at your face when it appears will slowly be consumed by the Blackening, the Disease. Every time you summon the Blackening, you will feel the pain you felt on your finger, over your whole body, increased tenfold. You will not pass out, but the pain will be unbearable. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The Disease is object 50 of 538. With it, you can Blacken anyone, even the immortal... <br><br>');

He will lead you down an ancient, creaking staircase made of wooden planks. It remains somehow suspended in an impossibly large room, the sides or bottom of which you will not be able to fathom. The only light will be from the quickly receding entryway. Vast, hulking shapes lumber in the darkness - I recommend that you do not make any noises louder than the gentle squeaking of the stairs. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Your guide will remain only a few steps ahead of you, but in the oppressive darkness his features remain unclear.

The demon at your back will have been slain. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>This next moment is crucial.

He appears rather young and is holding an ornately crafted, 18th century pistol in his right hand. He has several large tomes strapped to the saddlebags of his horse and bits of script in a foreign language are visible pasted, in a fashionable way, to various bits of his clothing. He will slowly approach you, making no move to dismount, but visibly interested in your appearance. You must hold his gaze until he disappears in the opposite direction. Following this exchange your exhaustion will suddenly catch up with you, and you will find it increasingly difficult to stay awake.

His contagious despair will punch through your skin, slither past your flesh and pierce through your bones, but take heed not to lose your focus - he is still their slave and his corrupted side will readily consume you if given the opportunity.

The wall to your left will have many doors. Do not open any of them under any circumstances, regardless of what sensations you feel urging you to do so. These feelings are scarcely more than base trickery. The doors restrain segments of your psyche mercifully shut away; to free them now is a grave mistake. The wall to your right is composed entirely of glass. Looking out this enormous window reveals whatever place you were born in, though entirely empty and devoid of life.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Walk the hallway. Its length is variable, so this may take even longer than your recent climb. At the opposite end, you will see a set of double doors.

The sound will seem impossibly loud, and will be accompanied by a blinding flash of light. He will be gone, and in his place, two other people will have appeared. To your left stands the object of your hatred: whomever you have borne more resentment towards than any other you have known. To your right, the one most dear to you. Living or dead, these people will appear in the flesh in front of you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Approach your mortal enemy, and wordlessly, he will hand you a knife.

Opening it will yield you nothing but a bemused smile from the secretary, as it will be empty. After a moment, she will draw your attention back to her and lead you into the principal\'s office After a few muttered words between the two the principal will welcome you with a handshake and proceed to open a trapdoor concealed under his desk He will hand you a dagger and offer a few grim words of luck before lowering you into the hole and closing the door For a moment you will be in total darkness but images will soon emerge in front of you You will recognize them as moments from your own life and as you watch you may come to realize that they are all connected Every moment of your life has culminated in this very moment and it is only with this realization that proceeding forward will become possible But worry not for this is a timeless place \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When you have accepted your fate a door will appear in front of you Through it is a single room with a closed door at the far end blocked off from you by a gate Once you are clear of the door you entered from it will slam shut and a person will materialize in front of you Confused they may prompt you for an explanation but regardless of your answer a fight will inevitably begin If at any time during the fight should your opponent\'s stomach be revealed, you will see that your own name is inscribed there. What this means, however, cannot be told. This battle will be one of the few moments of your life that is not scripted, and you will be well aware of the fact, as even moving your body will feel far more difficult than usual. Fortunately, the same holds true for your foe. Should you win the battle, the door at the far end of the room will open, and the gate will disappear. Fate will have lost its hold on you by this point, and what will happen to you beyond that door is beyond the knowledge of any being, but you can be certain that the chances of surviving without fate on your side are questionable at best. What is known, however, is that if you are an extremely lucky soul, you will eventually come to an ancient, rotting door. The doorknob will be lying on the ground before it, having long since rusted over and fallen from its place. One solid push is all it will take to open this door, and a cloud of dust will rise from the ground where it falls. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After the dust clears and you enter the room, you will be in an earthen cave. A small window, if it can be called that, will provide enough light for you to see three figures in the center of the room. The figures on the left and right, you will see as you draw closer, have been dead for many years. A stone is lodged in the skull of one, and the head of the second hangs at an awkward angle, its neck clearly broken. The figure in the center, however, still lives, despite its appearance, which clearly indicates that this being should have died centuries ago. The old crone, for that is what the center figure is, has only one eye. No ordinary eye, mind you, as it seems to shine with an otherworldly brilliance. Ask her this, and only this, lest she end your life in a manner so horrible that your worst fears would seem a blessing in comparison: \"What do you see?\" She will answer at her own pace, and impatience on your part will bring the full force of her considerable wrath upon you.  When she finally speaks, it will be in a tortured voice. She will tell you that she sees everything, but that she had lost sight of you as soon as your earlier battle started. Deciding that you are too great of a threat, she will attack you, with speed and strength seemingly impossible for her decrepit body to possess. You must act quickly, as one hit from her will destroy you utterly. Take the box you received earlier and open it. Be warned, though; the contents of that once empty box are not fit for human eyes, and if yours happen to be open when they emerge, your existence will end in a most terrifying manner. Once the box is opened, you will hear unearthly sounds. When they cease, close the box and open your eyes, but not a moment before. Looking around, nothing will have changed but for the crone. Time has caught up with her, as she will now be as dead as the other two figures in this room. Her eye is nowhere to be seen. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You now have two choices. Opening the box a second time will reveal an object that will grant you the power to control the past, present and future of the world, save for the room you reside in, and the ones you passed through after your battle. However, should you do this, you will be trapped in this room for all eternity, with no conceivable escape. Your second choice is to leave the room and brave whatever horrors you faced in order to get there. In either case, fate will no longer have any control over your life. Not long after, you will discover what a sickening burden it truly is to control your own destiny.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The Object that now lies within the box is number 76 of 538. There are some who are now aware of its existence.  May it never fall into the wrong hands. <br><br>'),

Perhaps she will touch your shoulder or arm, or perhaps she will tug on your pant-leg. Turn to face her, although she will not be there. You will find a run-down shack directly across or down the road from you. If a forbidding air seems to push you away from it, you know you have found the place. If you wish to spare yourself the innumerable horrors of the 2538 objects, turn back now. No-one will think the less of you. However, if you are brave, steel yourself and knock upon the plastic-siding door. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>It will slide back, revealing a beautiful woman in an elegant dress. Her eyes will be dark-ringed from lack of sleep, and red from crying for so many years. So many years. And those brown eyes were so vivid once. She will ask you if you truly believe in them. Tell her the truth, for if you are lying to her this day she will know, and your quest will end here. If you do tell her the truth, and she likes your answer, then she will invite you in. Remove your shoes once inside. She is a neat freak and would be angry if you tracked anything on the carpet. Yes, the inside of this ramshackle place will be opulent, bedecked in marble, gold, silks, and fine woods. Some exist here who remember building this for her. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Touch nothing as she escorts you into her lounge. Especially not the crystals. Once inside the lounge, sit at the low table as she reclines opposite you. This table is shaped like a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929160937/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagua_(concept)\" class=\"extpage\">bagua<img src=\"/web/20200929160937im_/http://theholders.org/images/extlink.png\" border=\"0\"></a>, with a crystal ball in the center and feet made from effigies of the other Objects. Do not look at them. Do not touch the ball. There will be time for this yet. She will ask you questions, deep questions about your dark secrets. Questions that will lay bare your every sin and failure. If she begins to cry, know this: she weeps for you, and she weeps for herself. Do not console her. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After a while, she will touch the crystal ball. Do so as well. She will ask your name. Give it in full. Your name will drift away into the crystal ball. She will ask your birthdate. Give it. It too, will drift away. She will ask you for your titles, your pseudonyms, your screennames, your nicknames. All will float away from you and into her crystal ball. When she bids you rise, do so, and follow her to her bedchamber. Here, she will lay out clothes on the bed and step outside, still clutching her crystal ball. Strip yourself naked in front of the mirror. Do not leave a single ring on your finger, or in your ear. You must be bare of all but your skin. Throw your clothes into the unlit fireplace. Dress yourself in the clothes that she laid out for you. Your fate will be sealed by the colors of the garments. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Lie down in the bed. Do not lie on your side or on your stomach, for if you do, you will stay there for all eternity, never able to sleep, but experiencing every nightmare there ever was or will be in every moment. Lie still for four minutes and thirteen seconds. If you stir, she will not come. When she does come she will be wearing the same clothes that you are, and her raven black hair will be deftly brushed. Her makeup will be done to a tee, and she will look ever so beautiful. This is your last glimpse of true beauty before your long journey of horror. She will toss your shoes into the fireplace and light it, burning all of your clothes and belongings. She will then lay down next to you in the bed, smoothing back your hair as a mother might her child. Watch in stillness as hundreds of grotesque servants enter the room. Do not look them in their pain-wracked eyes. Do not listen to their sullen murmurings. For if you do, they will make sounds that will slowly and painfully melt your every bone. They will then take your frameless form from the bed and consume you alive, inconsiderate and unworthy person you are. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>As long as you do not do these things, and you allow her to pet you, and you stay absolutely still, you may watch as these servants in their black clothing bring in your every belonging and throw it into the fire. Do not weep for the loss of these things. The worst is yet to come. When all your things have burned to cinders, she will roll over and straddle your waist. She will then poke and prod your muscles and nerves. At times she will seem to poke at your very marrow. She will then rise to her full height and say, \"You know what it is you must ask. Ask it.\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Ask her \"Am I the One Chosen to Seek Them?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>This may yet be your last moment with your mind, heart, soul and body intact. She will likely begin to cry ever harder. Her tears will splash down on your chest. She will begin to massage her tears into your skin. If at this point her nails dig into you, know that your every lie this day has been discovered. Foul creature, how could you lie to her? Her tears will leak into your veins and dissolve your will into a screaming husk, and you will serve to carry people\'s belongings for all eternity but never have any of your own\r\n<br>\r\n<br>She may look down at you in pity for you have come so far and experienced unimaginable horrors and have even told the absolute truth to her but you are not the Chosen She will apologize for what has been done to you and what you may have been forced to do She will then ask you \"Do you want to forget\" You may respond in one of three ways If you say yes all your belongings will be returned to you You will be returned to your home and will have no memory of the Holders the Objects or the horrors you have witnessed in seeking them If you say no as some do her house will vanish from around you You will have no clothes and no belongings but you will have knowledge of the Objects as well as whatever Objects you have already collected If you seek to collect them for personal gain this is the option to choose However you may say \"No but I wish to aid the Chosen\" In this case she will tell you the name and location of the Chosen You must immediately seek him out tell him of the Bride and turn over to him whatever Objects you possess After this as with the \"yes\" answer you will be returned to your home with all your belongings and no memory of the Holders\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If however she bends over and kisses you on the lips and your white garments touch hers know that you have been chosen She will tell you of the Holders who have been lost to documentation She will tell you the proper order in which to approach the Holders so that you may seek Them And by seeking Them seek Him She will then whisper into your ear your new name your name as the Seeker of Holders Know now that every person who knows of you will not remember any name pseudonym nickname or screenname you gave or ever will give them Only your name as the Seeker of Holders If you stand at the footsteps of any mental institution or halfway house and ask the wind to bring you the Bride of the Seeker her home will appear for you as a haven from your troubles \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You are now object 90 out of 538 the Seeker of Holders Whether you seek to gather them or destroy them we who have gone before you pray for your soul \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Do not let us down <br><br>'),

Only with their infernal strength will you survive this task. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you remain, the attendant will ask you to check the church at the end of the street, and return to his paperwork. Leave the building and walk leisurely down the street, and enjoy what may be your final moments alive. When you reach the end of the road, you will see an old, dilapidated structure that may have been a house of worship a long time past. Enter the door carefully, lest the frame collapse on you. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will be surrounded by light, and taken to the place where the objects you have gathered lay before you, along with two doors. Know now that if you lack the <a href=\"?Holder_of_Hate\" class=\"yespage\">Cloak</a>, the <a href=\"?Holder_of_Confusion\" class=\"yespage\">Beast\'s Resolve</a> the Shield <a href\"HolderofSolitude\" class\"yespage\">Holder of Solitude</a> or <a href\"HolderoftheShield\" class\"yespage\">Holder of the Shield</a> or the <a href\"HolderofPeace\" class\"yespage\">Sword</a> then take the door on the left and leave for you are doomed to fail If you possess one or more of these Objects then choose one and enter the door to your right \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will pass into a hellish expanse of wasteland its horizon surging with infernal flames and showers of blood pounding the barren ground beneath your feet Far in the distance a tall structure juts out its stark and polished whiteness blaring its presence to everything here And rest assured you are not alone \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will only have a handful of seconds to take in these sights before a horde of demons begins to rush towards you If you carry the cloak with you drape it over yourself and walk towards the building the creatures are an extension of the Holder who sees you through their hatred Otherwise arm yourself with the plain sword that appears at your feet as the king\'s blade will not come free should you wear it. The demons are numerous, but frail; they exist only as a thought, and one stroke will cleave them apart. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>No matter how you do so, it will take a very long time to reach the structure, but you will never find yourself tired from the exertions of moving or fighting - conflict is the food of life here, and you are part of its source. When you climb onto the first step of the entrance, the endless swarm of creatures pouring from its doors will finally halt, and the crowd that eagerly pressed against itself to flay you will calm and watch your every movement as you ascend to the large, opulent doors. They will part as you walk, forming a silent, vigilant ring that urges you toward their keeper. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The inside is just as lavish as its outer shell, dressed in fine fabrics and frescoes, beautiful statues, and beautiful mosaics inlaid into the floor. The Holder\'s minions will form a solid path from which you should not dare deviate they are much more resilient here within their home Follow your only sensible option for as long as it leads you but do not turn back or make to leave Your passage will lead to a spacious and stark room dotted only by a throne and two figures a naked beautiful brownskinned woman reclining in the seat and a pale man bedecked in armor kneeling on the floor in front of her Instantly you will feel a lust you have never felt before Ignore it or you will be flayed by the knight for your insolence\r\n<br> \r\n<br>Instead state without fear that you have come to answer the challenge With a wave of the woman the knight will rise don a helmet and bring sword and shield to bear Should you possess the sword the blade you were given will morph into a round shield and your own weapon will let itself be drawn Should you lack the sword the knight will toss one to you a shield letting it slide to a halt at your feet One way or another when you have equipped yourself properly a suit of half plate will form around you and the knight will charge \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Now it is up to you and your skills If you chose the sword know that his armor alone will not save him as the king\'s blade will batter and eventually pierce the heavy metal. If you opted to take the shield, then do not fear the knight\'s blade for it cannot break the hellish protector But whatever you decided be aware that the knight is a very formidable opponent he will use any means he can to defeat you whether it be his blade his shield or punishing steelhardened strikes from his hands and feet To best the knight you must cleave his sword arm from his body only then will he yield kneeling to you and ignoring the mangled bleeding stump \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you are victorious the woman will rise and walk towards you Kneel and hold your weapon tight in your hand She will tell you \"Obey the strong destroy the weak\" Now ignoring your temptation ram the blade through her gut and wrench it upwards heeding your temptation will only result in your being lost in eternal bliss and any objects you have collected will return to their holders As her body slumps to the floor sheathe your blade and offer the knight his missing arm As he holds it back to the wound his armor will shatter revealing him to be a humanoid figure with fireblackened skin golden hair and deep amethyst eyes that bore into your soul \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will compliment you on your fight and on seeing through his master\'s illusion. He will speak, in length, of the measures that were placed in this realm to guard the Object here, and how he extended them through himself. When he finishes, he will permit you to ask one question. You must request of him, \"Why do you follow Him, my lord?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The Holder will seat himself as he tells you, in a gravelly voice that holds the weight of ages of vows, how he fought his way into His favor, and describe, in painful detail, how he fought Him and lost. The words will take shape as the hell knight speaks, burning the images of the entire story into your memory. The Holder will explain the agonizing torture he suffered, and you shall feel his pain as he speaks. If your mind cannot endure this, then you will take the dead woman\'s place as the Holder\'s next decoy, but if you persevere, then the Holder will tell you the vow he took to escape the unending torment. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When this is finished, he will stand and offer you the only remaining piece of his armor; the gauntlet, which is still pristine despite the battle. Replace yours with the one you are offered. Then, the Holder will advise you to arm yourself again, for you must fight your way to the entrance of his home. Only when you are ready will he order his minions to attack. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you chose to carry the Beast\'s Resolve it will manifest itself now surging though your body and lending you the strength of the most fearsome of demons Otherwise it will be a long and savage battle to the front door If you manage to reach the foyer alive and rend through the frenzy around you to the door white light will surround you yanking you across dimensions and dropping you outside the wrecked church Everything will be gone your chosen Object returned to its place of Holding but the knight\'s gift will remain. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That gauntlet is Object 91 of 538, the Hand of Obedience.

Relax, for now the Holder is pleased with you. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When your relaxation has drifted you off into a state of utter bliss, the ash-fruit will be withdrawn from your mouth.

The hands that once caressed you will hold you tightly, almost painfully. you will be tilted into a vertical position and the long eye-stalks of the Holder will poke into your limited view.

Do not look at the eyes or hands, no matter what they do. Do not listen to the whispers coming from the hands on the side of your head.

He shall not complain or even try to stop you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>After going through the door, you will find yourself in a dark hallway. As you walk down it, you must walk at a steady pace. You will define the speed with which you have to walk: if you walk very fast, you will have to keep moving fast. If you move slowly, you will have to keep moving slowly. Failure to comply will result with instant death.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>At the end of the hallway, there are three paths. The centre path leads to the Holder. The path on the left leads back home, but the path back shall be painful beyond imagination. The path on the right leads to certain death, yet the death is painless and many consider this a more suitable fate than the painful journey back or the suffering in order to get the object.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you chose the centre path, you will walk on until you see a large, rectangular room in front of you. A man is sitting in a chair at the centre of the room, surrounded by chalk circles drawn into the floor. One circle for each object you have. If you have 5 objects, there are 5 circles. If you have 45 objects, there are 45 circles.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Walk towards the Holder. Be prepared, because he will shout at you in a large booming voice. His demand is simple: place the first object in the first circle. If you obey, and surrender the object to the Holder, the object placed in the circle will be gone and you will be required to get it again.  If you survive. If you refuse, the Holder will lift his hand and countless, minuscule hooks shall go into each of your pores. The pain will make you believe that you are being torn apart. If the pain stops and you have not gone mad with the agony, or have not screamed at him to take your object, he shall smile and say you are worthy of keeping the object. The process will repeat until he has asked for all of your objects. For objects that are too large to move, immaterial, or are otherwise impossible to be placed in a circle, the Holder shall ask if you want to place it in the circle. If you agree, the object will be lost, if you disagree, you shall be tortured once more. If you remain strong and he deems you worthy enough to keep them all, one of the hooks used in your many torture sessions will increase in size until it is the size of a normal fishing hook.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The hook is Object 113 of 538. Its only purpose is to get others to surrender their objects.\r\n<br> <br><br>');

(114, 'Holder of Reincarnation', 'In any city, in any country, go to any Hindu shrine or Buddhist temple you can get yourself to. When you arrive, ask the high priest or chief monk to see someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Reincarnation.\" If they tell you that there is nobody there by that name, leave post-haste; it is best left unsaid what happens if you linger too long. If you make it out successfully, never return to any Buddhist temple or Hindu shrine until someone close to you dies; after their funeral, you may try again. You may have to do this multiple times.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If they instead say, \"Indeed, it is so easy to understand, yet so impossible to destroy,\" you are fortunate enough to have located the Holder. The priest or monk should then lead you deep into the shrine or temple. Eventually you\'ll reach a hallway that seems... well, let\'s just use the phrase \"out of place.\" On the left wall, you\'ll see people dying the most gruesome of deaths. Coinciding with their deaths, you\'ll see the most foul creatures you\'ve yet seen spawning on the right wall. This is where the minions of every Holder are generated; they are the reincarnations of the most foul, damned men who have ever walked the earth. Take care not to focus your attention on any one creature, for they don\'t like to be seen in their \"incomplete\" state and will test their newfound powers on you without hesitation.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you progress down the hall, the people on the left will become more evil and the creatures on the right more revolting and hideous. Eventually, their power will feel overbearing, and you\'ll lose all desire to continue. Despite this, you must press onwards, for you don\'t want these beasts to sense your weakness.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Should you successfully reach the end, you\'ll find yourself standing in front of a door that seems to be made of parts of every living creature ever formed on earth. The priest or monk will move to open the door; <i>make sure</i>, above all else, that you open the door first. Should he open the door, the Holder will mistake him for the Seeker and will nail you, a mere intruder, to the wall with the damned men. If this happens, then hope you enjoy your new life as a Holder\'s minion. Should you open the door first, the monk or priest who accompanied you will suffer this fate in your stead.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Enter the room beyond; the door will shut behind you, silencing the wails of the condemned men and the howls of the newly-formed monsters. You will find yourself in a round chamber; on the stone walls is a series of moving lights that spiral upwards into infinity; don\'t follow the lights with your gaze, lest you be driven mad by the infinitude of it all. Standing in the center of the room is a being that is half-man. The other half is something so vile and horrendous that to gaze directly at it would mean an eternal life as an inconsolable, broken wretch. Wait patiently in this room with the creature; don\'t say anything or do anything save breathing, or the being will disappear, the floor will drop beneath you, and you\'ll fall downwards forever, witnessing every death and concurrent birth in the world all the while.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Suddenly, without warning, the being will lunge at you as if to attack. The only means of sparing yourself a fate best left unspoken is to ask, at this precise moment, \"Can any of Them be permanently destroyed?\" The being should then halt in its tracks, then tell you of mankind\'s futile efforts to break the wheel of samsara, that everlasting spiral of death and rebirth. He will provide solid evidence that the Buddha, the only human said to have ever escaped the cycle, was a fraud (you will then remember that he was the last of the condemned souls dying to form the Holders\' new legions). Suddenly you will realize that the spiraling lights around you are the physical manifestation of samsara. All this knowledge is too much for the average mind to comprehend; indeed, you may find yourself in a sudden \"blank\" state, your brain now unable to perform any tasks outside of maintaining your vitals (and even that will soon end). If your mind is above ordinary, however, break off one of the man\'s claws (if indeed that is what they can be called) and use it to slash a gaping hole into the chain of samsara. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Upon doing this, the Holder will cease to exist (for the cycle that reincarnation depends on is now no more), and he will leave behind a platinum swastika charm on a golden chain. Upon taking it, you\'ll find yourself outside any Hindu shrine or Buddhist temple save the one you started your journey in (though you should notice that it\'s in ruins). Good luck finding your way home.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That swastika charm is Object 114 of 538. Departed souls still need a place to go, you know. <br><br>'),
(115, 'Holder of Pestilence', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Pestilence\". At this point, the worker should gag, and try not to vomit. After several minutes of this, the worker will finally give in, vomiting into a wastepaper basket. They will then stand, and lead you down the hallway. You will reach a door, slightly ajar, but you must <i>not</i> touch it. To do so would invite its curse into your bones, and your fate would be sealed. Instead, demand that the worker open it for you. Pass quickly through the door â€“ the Holder is waiting. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will find yourself in a darkened room. The door behind you will slam shut â€“ again, to touch it would be to invite the Rot. Instead, walk ahead, in the dark, until you reach what feels like a stone altar. Reach over, until you find a groove. At this point, you must think only of home, and your friends, and the people you love, as something cold and wet will slide momentarily over your face. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After the deathly embrace is over, you will find the groove has split open, and the altar now reveals a staircase. Descend it, taking care not to trip. The Holder wouldnâ€™t want you damaged before you meet. Finally, at the bottom of the stairs, it is vital that you donâ€™t step off the final step. Instead, look as hard as you can until you see footsteps cleared among the ichor and rot coating the floor. Step only in these, as to touch the Rot is to join it. As you make your way forward, you will finally come to a stone sarcophagus. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Few people realize this, but the word \'Sarcophagus\' means \'Eater of Flesh\', and this is exactly what this coffin is. You must raise the stone lid, and lower yourself into it. Hold still. Itâ€™s sleeping. After a few moments, the room will be lit, ambient light slowly filling the room. You <i>must</i> remain still. If it wakes, all is lost. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After the room is lit to its brightest, you will hear a tapping noise, like someone is walking into the room, however, you will be unable to hear them. As the footsteps get nearer and nearer, you will hear a rasping voice speaking in an unknown language. At this point, most Seekers will find it important not to focus on the words, as they tell of truths mortals cannot comprehend. Finally, the speaker is silent. The base of the sarcophagus will raise, and it is now safe to move. The Holder is standing here. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>His skin is gangrenous and blackened, and his eyes are sunken. He will speak to you, in your native language, and ask you a series of questions about yourself. Answer truthfully, and your mind will remain intact. The Holder will ask you to hold out your left hand. He will reach out and place something cold into your palm, and then close your hand over it. For his ravaged appearance, the Holder is not an evil being, and wishes you luck. A door is now behind you. Passing through it will bring you back to the institution through which you passed. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The jewel in your hand is Object 115 of 538. Dare you wield the Rot-Stone unprotected? <br><br>'),
(116, 'Holder of Guilt', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls herself \"The Holder of Guilt\". Before the worker can answer, shut your eyes tightly and clench your jaw. Count to exactly twenty, then open your eyes. You should find yourself on an unassuming dirt footpath in a moderately wooded area. If you are in any other location, then you miscounted the seconds and have only minutes to live. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you are on the dirt path, then walk along it. You should feel, at all times, an eddy of wind playing against your ear. Should you ever stop feeling it, quickly stand still and shout into the foliage, \"I freely admit it was my fault!\" If the little eddy of wind does not return, then I suggest you make yourself comfortable and arm yourself, as these woods are now your home for all eternity, and they are filled to bursting with hidden creatures from the lowest pits of damnation, all eager to messily devour you. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the wind does return, then continue along the path as normal. After a long while you should find a battered little shanty. Knock twice before entering; failing to knock properly beforehand results in a punishment that cannot be adequately described in any human tongue. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Upon entering the shanty, you will find yourself in a clean little kitchen. Quickly shut the door behind you and remain standing, head bowed respectfully, where you entered. Fervently working the kitchen will be a woman who never turns to face you as she goes about her endless task of working on a meal that will never be finished. If you pay attention, you will notice that she works to an exact rhythm, but this is not terribly important - just an interesting detail. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>There is only one question to which this woman will respond: \"Why is it their fate to be used for wrong?\" Give her a moment; it will take a while before she gets around to answering. When she does, she will recount in your mother\'s voice (even if you have never heard your mother\'s voice), and in explicit detail, every wrong you have ever visited upon others, no matter how trivial, no matter if it was intentional or unintentional. No matter how shameless, unrepentant, or vile a person you are, or even if your wrongdoings are few or barely extant, you will feel the weight of your wrongdoing pressing down on you. Remain standing in your respectful pose even as the weight of your wrong increases to unbearable levels. If ever you falter, you will be crushed, doomed to remain a broken heap on the floor of this kitchen listening to the woman repeat herself forever. Then again, that would mean you were never worthy of collecting all the Objects in the first place. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once every wrong has been recited in excruciating detail, if you are still standing, the woman will ask you to retrieve an ingredient from a top cupboard. Go fetch it. <i>Do not</i> open any cupboard other than the one indicated, and <i>do not</i> turn your head in a way that would allow you to see the woman\'s face. There are fates worse than what would happen if you do either, but the list is very short. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The ingredient she is looking for is the only spice that has no label. Hand it to her in a way that prevents you from looking her in the face, then return to where you were standing earlier. Wait a while, and she will eventually offer a small sample of her cooking for you to eat. Walk over to her and accept it (being careful not to put yourself in a position to see her face). It is a sizable chunk of cooked beef. Thank her politely, tell her you had a wonderful time visiting and will come back another day, then quietly leave via the door through which you came. You will find you have walked out of a supply closet in the mental institution. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The food you acquired from the Holder is no ordinary beef. It never rots, no matter how old it gets, and eating even a small bite of it will instantly heal all your wounds, no matter how grave. It does this, however, by transferring said wounds to someone you care deeply about. Survival in the future of this quest will make eating this beef necessary at least a few times. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That chunk of cooked beef is Object 116 of 538. Hopefully the Objects are important enough to sacrifice people you genuinely care about. <br><br>'),
(117, 'Holder of the Syzygy', 'In any city, in any country, go to any warehouse or factory you can get yourself to. When you reach the receiving desk, ask to claim the shipment for someone called \"The Holder of the Syzygy.\" The secretary will not believe you in the slightest, but be resolute and if necessary ask to speak to the foreman. He will arrive in time, and will also mock you, saying he\'s never heard of such a person. Be patient and he will eventually consult the records, the color draining from his face when he finds the name in his papers. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will then lead you onto the floor of the factory, but he will demand that you wear eye protection. You should have the <a href=\"?Holder_of_the_Lens\" class=\"yespage\">Eyes</a> by now, and though this is not their true purpose, only they will suffice for this occasion. If you do not have the Eyes, you will be wasting your time and your life. <a href=\"?Holder_of_the_Lens\" class=\"yespage\">Put on the Eyes</a> before following him. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The foreman will lead you to the oldest and furthest section of the factory. There will be seemingly endless rows of boxes and crates here, but do not break stride and do not examine the labels and destinations on any of them. You will find them to be years, even decades old, with strange destinations and even stranger contents, but they are valueless in your quest. Instead, keep your eyes fixed on the foreman. He will be eager to lose you around the next row of musty cardboard pallets. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After what might seem like a day\'s worth of walking down never-ending aisles, the foreman will stop before a single, massive crate. It is wooden but does not appear to be made from individual planks, instead, it looks as though carved from a single massive piece of the darkest wood imaginable, almost black. Set into the box is a door. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the crate emits a high pitched whine, a kind of buzzing noise, or seems to vibrate slightly, then you can breathe a quick sigh of relief that what is inside is still what you seek. But if the air by this box is filled with only silence, or any other sound, then what you seek within has been destroyed, and you may now search the crates nearby for some instrument to end your life, for you have no hope of leaving this modern labyrinth. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will find the door unlocked; you need not even knock before entering. You will then be standing in complete darkness; only the Eyes will reveal the true nature of the space you are now standing in. You will find yourself standing near the center of a massive web of rings, all centered around a small dais with a reclining chair, not unlike a dentist\'s chair. The difference in function becomes terrifyingly apparent as you approach--the chair is surrounded by hundreds of scalpels, each on its own articulated arm, poised above the chair. Strapped in to the seat is a mannequin made of the same dark wood the crate was fabricated from. Where the face of the mannequin should be, however, is carved a divot like a bowl. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Use one of the scalpels to cut yourself and add a few drops of your blood to this bowl. Immediately, the mannequin\'s body will turn from wood into flesh, and its appearance will be yours. You should stand back as the scalpels descend, making a frenzy of cuts on your doppelganger\'s body. You will hear your own screams, the flesh that is sliced will be yours and not yours. At this moment, the rings will shift in the vast darkness around you, eventually ceasing in their alignment at some point. Some will remain frozen in the air above or below you, while many others will settle themselves in a neat row on the horizon. The number of marks on the mannequin-you\'s flesh is the number of Objects you have gathered; the rings show your progress the same way. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The mannequin-you will curse and plead for you to stop the pain or end its suffering, but you must coldly ask it, \"When will they align?\" The not-you will beg, plead, and grovel for mercy as the scalpels slowly start to descend, crying for you to stop it, but you must say nothing and must not look away. This time, the blades will make five hundred and thirty-eight slices, all but flaying the mannequin-you to ribbons. The rings will now all be aligned on the horizon, and a long light will land on the dais, showing you the way home. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Before you leave, take from the ruined chest of the mannequin-you a small leather-bound book. Then follow the light until you find yourself outside the factory once more. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The star atlas you now hold is Object 117 of 538.

(118, 'Holder of Joy', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Joy\". The worker will shudder violently and ask that you reconsider. Insist gently, and he will reluctantly relent. He will open a hatch on the ceiling above you, and offer to boost you up through it. Accept his offer. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Upon emerging from the hatch, you will find yourself in an old factory, similar to the old 18th-century sweatshops of large American east coast cities. It is dirty and dimly lit, and the noise of the machines will be so loud you will find yourself incapable of thought. Before you will be a long catwalk over the large factory floor filled with massive machines; walk along that catwalk. Working the many hot, hellish, and clattering machines are small children, though they are so weary and ragged you might mistake them for elderly people. In what little light there is you can make out their filthy, pleading faces, full of desperation and a wish to be free from their endless torment. Just keep walking; no mortal can help them, and should you attempt to do so you will join them in their eternal and pointless labor. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>It will take a long time, but eventually you will reach a door to the foreman\'s office. Enter to find a plain, gruff man, built like a brick, who appears to be in his late 40s and is wearing a rather plain white button-up shirt. Once he notices you, he will look up from whatever he was doing and regard you with a disgusted glare. With confidence, ask him one question: \"Can any joy come from it?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once the question has been asked, the foreman will stand and leave the office. Follow him. You will both be on the catwalk once again, whereupon he will shout a command to the child workers. What he says exactly will be lost in the din of machinery, but the child laborers will understand. The children will throw themselves into the machinery, altering the sound in horrible ways. You will clearly hear the bones snap and muscles rip as the children are torn and crushed by the machines, into which they unquestioningly threw themselves. Throughout this nightmare spectacle, you will hear the Holder\'s voice explain the true nature of joy and pain, though I will not write it here for only the worthy may know it. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once all the child laborers have been thoroughly shredded by the hellish machinery, the foreman will tell you to go back to his office and wait for him there. Do as he says, and upon entering the office door you will find yourself in whatever place you most often sleep at night. On your bed (or whatever sleeping surface you use) will be a plain white button-up shirt just like the one the foreman wore. This shirt will bestow a sense of familiarity and camaraderie with those you speak to.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That shirt is Object 118 of 538. You now know joy, and as such, may never have it. <br><br>'),

When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Cowardice\". As the last syllable leaves your lips, the worker will immediately and roughly grab the collar of your shirt; let him, do not resist. He will shout incoherently at you while shaking you angrily. After some time of this, he will appear to calm down and let you go. He will beckon for you to walk down a staircase that was not there before. Walk down the stairs, even though they are impossibly dark. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will emerge into what appears to be a small garden. The worker will tell you to wait here, and will then go back the way he came, leaving you alone in the garden. Wait in that garden; feel free to stroll around it all you like and make yourself comfortable. After a long while - hours, perhaps - two men will appear where you are not looking. One man is tall, brawny, and handsome in a proud, heroic way, and wears a suit of knightly armor. The other is a mouse of a man: scrawny, balding, nearsighted, lacking any kind of posture, lacking a chin, and clad in a threadbare brown suit. Once you have laid eyes on these two men, remain still and betray no movement as they stare at you. Eventually the knight will make a gesture that indicates you may speak. At this gesture, ask one question: \"If we stop now, what is the price?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once the question is asked, the scrawny man will suddenly tackle the knight with immense strength and proceed to rip him apart with savage ease, using just his bare hands. The knight, in spite of his heroic and powerful appearance, will be helpless against the fury of the scrawny man, who will first tear away the knight\'s breastplate, then rip into the knight\'s body, spattering everything in the garden with blood and gore. When this happens, stand still and watch the entire meaningless slaughter, no matter how horrible the knight\'s cries of pain and pleas for mercy. Once the knight has been thoroughly rent asunder - he was a large man, so this will take a long time - everything - the garden, the scrawny man, and you - will be soaked red with the knight\'s blood. Then a young, beautiful girl, no older than seven years old, will appear. She is the knight\'s daughter. The blood-drenched scrawny man will gesture to her; he wants you to kill her in the exact same manner he killed the knight. Do it, or else the scrawny man will consider you in league with the knight, and you will be butchered next. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Set about slaughtering and ripping apart the little girl with your bare hands as the scrawny man wanted. The girl will not offer any physical resistance, though her crying and whimpering will be unbearable. As you commit this violent and senseless deed, the scrawny man will crouch down next to you and whisper into your ear, telling of every instance in human history where courage resulted in pain and death, and where cowardice only made matters worse. He will explain, in excruciating detail, the true consequences of courage and the true cost of cowardice. Once the little girl has been reduced to a lifeless red pulp by your own bare hands, the scrawny man will smile. He will pick up the dead knight\'s blood-spattered breastplate and hand it to you, then with a warm, friendly countenance gesture you to leave. Go through the door through which you came and make your way back to the institution. Once you have made it back, I suggest you find a way to clean yourself, your clothes, and the breastplate, as all are still coated thickly with the knight\'s blood. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The breastplate is Object 119 of 538.

It may be the last thing you see before you suffer an undying death, torn to shreds and meaty chunks no larger than pocket change... But you will still be conscious. You will feel everything as your remains are added to batter, then put in the hellish heat of the oven, unable to scream, unable to see, only aware of yourself roasting and eventually being slowly devoured and digested. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>It would be much, much wiser to accept. She will again smile charmingly. â€œLovely! Hand me that measuring cup.â€ \r\n<br>\r\n<br>All the while, stay by her side. Do not wander to the red side of the room, and do not touch any of the baked goods. Each time you begin to ask her a question, she will speak over you, asking for an item or for you to hold something. You must attempt to question her 12 times before she gathers all the ingredients. One too many or less, and you will suffer the undying death. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After collecting and mixing, she will cross over to the red side of the room. It is hot and uncomfortable here, and instantly, she will turn to her true form, as will the ingredients.

The worker will give a solemn, knowing nod and beckon you to follow him. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will lead you down a long hallway and eventually gesture for you to enter a door. Do not enter this door. Instead, enter the door on the exact opposite side of the hall. You will come upon another hallway. At the door you entered will be a man who is almost identical to the worker who led you, except this one is a mirror-image version, with all features reversed. Ask once again for the Holder, and this mirror worker will give a solemn, knowing nod and beckon you to follow. If you say anything else after this point, then this mirror world will collapse upon you, erasing all evidence that you ever existed. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The worker will take you back to the front desk and gesture for you to exit out the front door. Do this, and you will find yourself in an incalculably vast room. It will be impossible to determine the room\'s appearance or features, as it is filled with sourceless, eye searingly bright lights - too bright for your vision to adjust, so that the entire room appears to be a blaze. Just walk forward on ground that feels like sand.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Start walking in any direction into the room. Everything should be completely silent, but if at any point you hear a high whistle, like the sound of a teapot, then stop immediately and shout with all the ferocity you can muster, \"I can see what I must do!\" It is best you not know what eternal horrors await you should the whistling continue. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the whistling stops, however, then you are to proceed as you were. Eventually, no matter which direction you walked, you will come upon a small area of the vast room where the lights, by some strange means, are not quite as blinding. Sitting in a meditative cross-legged position in the exact middle of this area is a peaceful-looking thin man wearing nothing but a loincloth. He has not a single hair on his entire body, but it is his head that is truly unusual. He has neither nose nor ears, and his mouth has no lips, so that it is just a slit on his placid face. His eyes have odd pupils, exactly like those of a goat. This man will have his arms held forward and his hands clasped together as though hiding a small object between them. He will stare at you impassively until you ask one question: \"What lies in the depths of His heart?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The man with the goat eyes will give a knowing but benign grin, then open his hands. Darkness will flow out from them like a mist, very slowly filling the room. It is crucial that during this time you stare intently into the man\'s strange eyes, for otherwise you will be consumed by this darkness forever. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>As the darkness overwhelms the light, it will reveal the true forms of the goat-eyed man and this vast room. The man is a truly nightmarish specter, more bone than flesh, his countenance no longer suggesting peaceful benevolence but rather a dark and violent hatred. You will see in the distance the immense walls of this room; they are made up of a collage of anguished faces. These are the souls of every Seeker who has ever failed the test of any Holder. The visions of the man and the room will overwhelm your sight as a loud crackling sound, like that of a raging fire, overwhelm your ears. No matter what, though, you must keep your gaze fixed upon the man\'s eyes. After what seems like an eternity, the assault on your senses will stop abruptly, and the room will revert back to its light-filled state, the man once again a tranquil in meditation. The goat-eyed man\'s arms will be outstretched, presenting a little brown bag. Take the bag gently and give a respectful bow before turning to leave. Go back the way you came: back through the mirror world and into the hallway of the regular world. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The gelatinous substance in that bag is Object 121 of 538.

Run for your insignificant life, and do not stop until the sun rises the next morning. The medical interns have lost their patient, and are eager to find someone else to treat. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the Object you seek is still there, the patient will go into a massive seizure, and the medical staff accompanying him in the ambulance will try to save him. The patient will thrash violently, disemboweling the EMTs working on him using whatever is at hand. During this time, you must not move from your current position or the patient will come for you next. Once the patient has done away with his victims, you must ask one question, lest you be maimed for eternity: \"What was the price for longevity?\" The patient will then tell a horrific story, a story showing every malpractice, every accident, every excuse and every experiment in medical history that helped to bring about the convenience people enjoy today.

From the echoes that come from the doors will hear that the inhabitants of these rooms are busy doing something, though what this something is you donâ€™t know, and would be better off not knowing. The inhabitants scream intensely, seething with madness and obsession over their assigned tasks. These were the previous Seekers foolish enough to look into the windows or fail the Holderâ€™s test.

Youâ€™ll hear the sound of flesh tearing, bones breaking, and the crackling of great fires. Ignore all of this and continue toward the center. You will know that youâ€™re an inch from the creature once you cannot see anything and you cannot hear your own thoughts over the screams of the damned. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Through the madness all around you only one thing can stop it.

He will recount how with every step he took forward, the closer he came to insanity, being pushed by unseen forces, drilling constantly into his mind, to know everything that he can about Them, and how it ultimately resulted in his destruction. The eyes will then fade, and all will return to darkness. You will feel an object being handed to your right hand, take it. If you feel it in your left hand, you can do nothing but kill yourself with it and end your journey there. If it was in your right hand, raise it and slash it to where the creature wouldâ€™ve been. You will feel the resistance of flesh, so make it one decisive cut. From your slash will be a bright light, blinding you.

You may now peruse the menu. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will find that the menu is in fact a long, winding narrative about your life from the moment you were born. Read it carefully; it may take many, many hours. You will find that you have many memories, especially in your early childhood, that are long-forgotten. These are memories all humans share, but nobody remembers them; the mind deletes these memories for sanity\'s sake, so hellish are they. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When you read the descriptions of these memories, however, they will return to your mind with full power. You may well snap at the ferocity of the experiences you never knew you had, but you must not show any sign of weakness, for they are watching. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you read, the waitress will come by periodically to ask if you are ready. Tell her you still need more time, and she should leave. If she doesn\'t leave and instead remains at your table, then they have become impatient. Your only hope is to dash IMMEDIATELY for the exit and out the door, and to keep running, down the street, out of the city, and on and on until the city is far, far behind you. If you value your life, you will never again set foot in that city. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>But if you manage to read through the entire story safely, you will find that it ends rather abruptly at the point where you enter the diner, then give way to a rather mundane-looking menu listing that features hamburgers, french fries, milk shake, and the usual fare of such themed diners. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The next time the waitress comes by, order \"Joe\'s Hamburger Special\", even though such an item is not listed on the menu. The waitress will turn 360 degrees, and when she faces you once again she will somehow be holding a plate with a monstrous hamburger on it. When she gives you the hamburger, begin eating it. You may notice that the hustle and bustle in the diner has stopped completely, and all of the carbon-copy employees are now intently spectating your meal. Pay them no mind and wolf it down. When you are done, the waitress will ask, \"Would you like the check?\" you which you must nonchalantly reply, \"Why do they flee from their memories?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>As soon as the words have escaped your lips, all of the identical employees will suddenly double over and, while emitting grotesque, painful sounds, vomit blood. A moment later, the entire diner will shift rapidly, and you may realize that the entire place is acting as though it is being sucked into a vacuum. When this happens, grip tightly to the table and do not let go, for the table at which you sit will be the only object in the diner that will not be sucked into the vacuum. The pull is immensely powerful, and it will be nearly impossible to keep your grip on the table through the ordeal, but still you must hang on, for there is no hope for you should you be drawn into the vacuum. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>It will feel like an eternity, and the entire process will be violent and powerful, but eventually everything but the table will be gone without a trace. You will find you are clinging to a table in the middle of an unoccupied field several dozen miles away from the city in which you started. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That table is Object 128 of 538. They want so badly to forget, but you know better than to deny your past. <br><br>'),

Ask the first employee or volunteer you see if he knows where one can find \"The Holder of the Downtrodden.\" If the worker looks around to make sure nobody\'s listening before he responds, then you have come to the right place. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The worker will imply that he requires a bribe before he will take you where you must go. Give him a substantial amount of cash, and hopefully he will consider it a large enough amount. He will then show you to a door that was not there before, which will lead to a staircase the building should not have. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The worker will take you to a nonexistent floor with many, many rooms arranged in a chaotic fashion. The rooms do not have hallways connecting them, and thus one must walk through various rooms to get to his destination. The worker will make his way through the illogically-arranged floor with speed and efficiency born of experience, and it will be difficult to keep up. You must keep up, however, for being lost on this floor is eternal emptiness. Also, be sure to keep your attention focused solely on the worker whom you follow: the rooms through which you walk are occupied with people who have given in to despair and loneliness, and to pay them any heed is to join them forever. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After what will have felt like days, the worker will bring you to the only empty room, then gesture wordlessly to the door on the other end. Humming nonchalantly to himself, he will walk back the way he came, leaving you in that empty room. If you have any doubt in your heart, then you\'d best leave, and hopefully catch up with the worker. Otherwise, push through the door. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will find yourself in a dingy rathole of a place. Despite the effects of centuries of neglect, the room is just barely recognizable as a living room of sorts. On a seat that once was a respectable recliner will be a dour-looking old man. There is something to the man that tells of a life once filled with pride and success, but somewhere along the line went into a sharp nosedive that brought him to the bottom of the barrel. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>With an angry-sounding, though unconvincing, bark, the old man will demand to know why you\'ve come. Immediately snap back that it is none of his business, and assume a posture and demeanor as though you have absolutely no respect for this old man - that he is, to you, just human trash, not worthy of respect or dignity. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you are convincing enough, the old man will cave in and lose what little bluster he had. He will meekly bow his head and become silent. Now you must rummage around the room as though you own place. Open every little cabinet and drawer you find, and rifle through. Take anything you like; so long as you maintain your facade of domination, nobody will dare stop you. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After you have looked through every storage place in the room, march up to the old man and demand to know where your payment is. The man will mumble and fumble for a while, but you must force a direct answer out of him, even if physical force is required. If you are successful, he will tell you how he ended up in his current situation. It is a story of dreams crushed by insensitive rivals, of opportunities missed, of dreams dashed by unfeeling bureaucracies, of success destroyed by a society mired in dogmatism. This man once had great potential and resolve to change the world for the better, but the world he tried to save turned right around and destroyed him for his noble efforts. It is a story of uncaring powers-that-be, of close friends becoming enemies in the name of ambition, of loved ones turning away because they only cared about themselves, even after everything he\'d sacrificed for them. If you feel any remorse - any at all - for what you have done to this man after hearing his story, then you are doomed to take his place. You must harden your heart and feel no compassion if you wish to remain free. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once the old man\'s story is finished, grab him by the collar of his shirt and snarl, \"What do they gain from the suffering they inflict?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>As the answer rips from him with force enough to bring you to your knees, you will gain the <b>exact</b> answer to your question. What little life was left in the old man will leave him, and he will sink back into his pathetic excuse for a chair. Now you may exit through the door from which you entered, which will open directly into the homeless shelter or soup kitchen in which you started. You will feel, right then, that what little compassion, what little care for others, you had inside you has died with that old man. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The hardness in your heart is Object 129 of 538. Your path will lead only to despair and oppression, for which the meek and compassionate will suffer the most. <br><br>'),

Enter the door, and you will find yourself in another hallway, this one without doors. Make your way down this bare hallway, making sure to exude nothing but confidence. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Should you, while walking down the hallway, hear a soft applause, stop immediately and shout, \"I do not deserve any credit!\" If the applause continues, then be thankful that your end will come quickly, though not without extreme pain. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the applause dies down, you may proceed. At the end of the hall, the wall will be bare. Push the bare wall to find that is a hidden door; the entire wall will spin around and allow you passage. Enter to find yourself on a half-complete, harshly-lit stage. The rows of seats before the stage are all empty, save for one at the front and center. There sits the director, a man who appears to be in his late twenties, though you may notice he has no eyes. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Before you have a chance to collect your thoughts, the director will proceed to bark out a series of directions. Without missing a beat, you must do the exact opposite of each command, so think and act quickly. The director will grow increasingly agitated as you fail to carry out his directions, but you must not allow his anger to disrupt you, for breaking the rhythm at this point would mean inviting your understudy to take your place. No words can adequately describe what that would entail. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After hours of exhausting instruction and mounting frustration, the director will throw up his hands in defeat and declare you unworthy of playing the part. Before he has a chance to rise from his seat, quickly ask one question: \"What is the part I must play?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The director will guffaw incredulously and shake his head. Then, with a flick of his wrist, the stage below you will vanish, and you will fall into a seemingly bottomless pit. As you fall, you will hear the sounds of the most brutal massacres to ever occur, and those yet to come. You will hear the bones of the innocent crushed under the boots and treads of good and evil alike. Through it all, you will come to understand what your part is. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Be prepared for when you finally hit water; from the height you will have fallen, hitting the surface will be a painful blow. Allow yourself to sink to the bottom, for when you come into contact with the floor, you will appear suddenly in a cell in the institution. Lying at your feet will be a stack of papers stapled together. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you read any part of what is written on those papers, then you accept your part in the script. Refusing to accept the part means one day being a victim of His rise. To accept the part means one day becoming the person responsible for it. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The script is Object 130 of 538.

Should the worker glare at you, run for dear life, as you were deemed unworthy by the Holder of the Object you seek. Do not stop for anything, as those that are after you do not know the meaning of rest, and will hunt you down relentlessly until they find you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Should you be deemed worthy by the Holder, you will be taken down a hallway that wasn\'t there before. In many of your previous adventures you are sure to have experienced much deception as the Holders try and try to lose you and protect their items. As the worker leads you down to your destination, you must harbor no wariness to the worker\'s intentions. You will get what you came for, if and only if you are worthy and your thoughts are pure. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After following the worker for what seemed like an eternity, you will come to a plain wooden door. The worker will open the door for you and leave you to be on your way. If at any time during your walk with the worker you harbored thoughts of possible deception, two blood-red eyes will stare at you from the darkness of the opened door. There is no use crying for help now, for even the highest of powers are incapable of saving you. But if you were loyal to your intentions, there will be a battle taking place beyond the door. As you walk in the door will shut itself behind you, and you will find yourself in the middle of the chaos. You will then be captured by soldiers speaking in a language that is not of this earth. There is no use resisting, as they are capable of inflicting pain that is worse than anything you can ever imagine. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After they take you to their camp, you will then be accused of being a spy and will start torturing you. At this point they will try to make you confess and you must conjure up all your strength and try to weather this storm. Then the soldiers will turn into all the people you have ever scammed, squandered, and betrayed. They will then continue to pound on you not only physically, but also mentally as they remind you of every wrong the you have ever done to them. Many give up at this stage, and now they pay for their treachery with the lowest of the damned. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must endure this until the soldiers\' superior officer appears. You can tell by the uniform and wolf-like creature that accompanies him, and also that the officer takes the form of the person you love the most. Once the Holder reveals himself, with all your remaining energy shout out, \"Would you ever suspect me?!\" At this point the other soldiers will stop, and the commanding officer will then narrate every betrayal in history, the pain it caused, and the destruction it resulted in. He will then go on to explain the true benefits of loyalty, along with the thin and dangerous line it runs beside fanaticism. If you did not go mad before, those who are not destined to finish this journey will surely crack at knowledge that the world will never be ready for.

Iâ€™m a huge fan.â€ Gratefully accept the pick and thank the worker, then leave the institution. You will notice that night has fallen when you exit the building, no matter what time you first entered. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Directly across the street will be a bar, even if it wasnâ€™t there before. Go to that bar, and you will hear music playing. Pay no attention to the music, as those now in the audience were those foolish enough to stop and enjoy it. These unfortunate individuals are now forever tormented by tunes that melt their bodies and souls while their ears bleed, their hearing undiminished in the face of this demonic harmony. Head backstage, where a bouncer will be waiting. When he blocks your path, show him the guitar pick you received from the worker. If the bouncer still does not let you through, pray that he takes off your head first, so that you wonâ€™t have to feel the pain of being torn apart by his bare hands. If he lets you through, you will be guided into a room, which, unlike the fancy bar dÃ©cor that surrounded you earlier, will be a simple room, with walls painted in beige and a single lamp hanging overhead. In the middle of a room will be a man who by all appearances looks like a rock star, with long, wavy hair, a thin physique, and tight jeans. He will be playing an electric guitar, and next to him will be another chair with a second guitar resting on a stand beside it. Untold horrors and nightmares await you should this scene not be the one you encounter when the bouncer lets you through. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The guitarist will be playing the most beautiful of tunes. He plays so skillfully, itâ€™s as if his fingers were gently treading water at the beach. You will be mesmerized by his skill, but all the more with the music he is playing. Yet you feel that it is a sad song, and its tragic message will reverberate within your very soul with every pluck of the string. Many are driven to depression at that very moment and decide to end their own lives, but if you are steadfast, you must sit down beside the guitarist. Once you do this, he will stop playing and say, â€œWill you share this song with me?â€  At this point you are only allowed to ask one question: â€œYouâ€™re that famous guy, right?â€ \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the guitarist does not answer, he has deemed you unworthy of his presence and the strings of his guitar will latch on and fillet your body, then drag your soul into the deepest pits of Hell. But if he likes you, he will say, â€œItâ€™s not all it was hyped up to be.â€ Here you must pick up the guitar beside you and play along with him. Even if you donâ€™t know how to play the guitar, you will find you suddenly know how to. The two of you will then play a song different from what the guitarist was playing earlier. As you play your part, you will start seeing sad and powerful images in your mind, but you must keep your concentration. The guitarist doesnâ€™t like screw-ups, and you donâ€™t want to know what he did with his previous back-up guitarists. With the images boring into your mind like red-hot steel hissing into your skin, you will see every person in history who was blinded by the glamour of the camera lights, and failed to see the real light of the sun, ultimately falling into eternal darkness. They thought they were special, and lifted themselves above anyone who they saw dirty or unfit, only to realize they were filthier than those they hated so much, and that they were just like everyone else.

After two weeks a package will be sent to you, and inside will be the guitar you played earlier.

The woman will continue walking ahead of you, but will not speak or slow down. It will become increasingly apparent that every animal is sick or injured in some way, and their conditions grow worse as you progress down the hall. Some are missing eyes or limbs, others bleed from open wounds. The floor grows thicker with matted hair and feathers, cages appear caked with feces and flies buzz loudly in your face. The stink is overpowering, and the air is hot. You will come to a sharp turn, then another, then another. Your guide will disappear around the third or fourth bend, but continue forward, quietly. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will notice that the animals themselves become subtly more peculiar as you wander what now feels like a veritable labyrinth for hours on end. You will see animals from far-off continents, rodents of unusual size and colorful reptiles you have never heard of, but even as the creatures become more exotic, so too their afflictions become increasingly horrendous. Pus weeps from open sores, bloated ticks scramble over scabrous flesh and blood flows in large rivers from small bodies. Some creatures are all but hidden under globular tumors and cysts. Animals reach out to you, pleading with their eyes - if they have eyes - to end their existence, but do not dare touch them, or you will carry their afflictions for life. Do not attempt to let any animal free, or it will kill you no matter how helpless and small it appears.

Dogs pace and whine without heads. Gore-crusted skeletons scrabble at rusted bars. You will see things long extinct and things that were yet to evolve, squawking and croaking for food and water that will never come. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Eventually, you will arrive in a perfectly round chamber, small but impossibly high.

When it is finished speaking, ask the creature, \"can I fix this?\" If it yet brings up its family, now is a good time to run. You were not meant to be here. If it says \"do what you must,\" kill the animal by any means possible.

When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls herself \"The Holder of the Fact.\" The worker will slowly turn their head up from the inevitable mounds of paperwork they were focused on, and a sly grin should slide across their features, as if in silent mockery. They will slowly stand and lead you towards the entrance to the institution. Instead of the entrance, however, is a large gothic staircase. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you climb the stairs, you will hear insane blasphemies uttered by gibbering voices, and the cry of someone in pain calling out your name from the foot of the stairs, begging you to abandon this madness. It is vitally important that you continue up the stairs, as only horror awaits at the foot of them now. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Eventually, you will come to a large door at the top of the stairs. Grip the handle strongly, close your eyes, and enter. Just keep walking ahead. No matter what you hear, no matter what you feel, it is crucial that you do not open your eyes. Regardless of which direction you headed in, you should soon find yourself at a dead end. In front of you is a shelf, entirely empty except for a small, unassuming leather book.

Crouched in the corner, nearly invisible in the dust storm stirred up by your intrusion, crouches the Holder. She scribbles madly, the scratching of the ancient quill in her hands forms into subconscious words in your mind, even as the Holder continues to write. The quill tells you of ancient horrors, of immemorial madness, of the absolute bitterness of the uncaring cosmos, and it tells you of your tiny, meaningless existence, as mere ink blot in the sprawling infinity of our universe, and finally, the insane scratching will tell you the one piece of information that leaves many a Seeker a broken shell of a human. The quill will tell you Their true name. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That name is Object 136 of 538. Know Them to know Him. <br><br>'),

He will then continue walking deeper into the institution without another word. There is no turning back; open the door and plunge in before you even see what is inside. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will fall for about ten feet before slamming onto a marble floor in a massive throne room. If you break bones due to the fall, then there is no helping you. The throne room in which you will find yourself is not only enormous, but lavish, with heavy obsidian pillars leading up to a massive, sprawling throne draped with heavy black cloths and lined with fine gold designs. The throne is so large that it can accommodate the several dozen scantily-clad women - all chained by ankle braces to the floor - seated all about it in addition to the warrior-king on the throne. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The warrior-king is a towering, muscular man with the bearing of a proud, confident, and predatory warrior. He wears nothing but a loincloth, exposing his rippling muscles and countless battle scars. His force of will is so great as to be physically palpable. This warrior-king has clearly seen many battles and is strong enough to slay a thousand men with ease. He will fix you with a stony glare of utter contempt. Be quick, for the warrior-king has little patience. Ask him, \"To what power will they submit?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The warrior-king will roar with laughter, not of mirth but of condescension directed at you. He will boast that no entity is more powerful than he, and that he cares not for the Holders or the Objects or Him. He will demand that you cease your quest and become one of his lieutenants, that he will provide you anything you need, no matter how outrageous the request, so long as you never leave his palace nor think or speak of the quest for the Objects ever again. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The warrior-king\'s power is so great that even the staunchest, most determined person might be swayed to submit to him. Nevertheless, if you are truly determined to collect the Objects, you must stand strong and not bow to his immense presence. Instead, firmly repeat the question. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>This time, the warrior-king will roar angrily. His concubines will be scattered and smashed against the obsidian pillars by the force of his outburst, and the very foundations of the throne room will tremble with his rage. You will certainly be sent sprawling, but do not allow yourself to be cowed by the warrior-king\'s rage. This time, the warrior-king will call you a fool among commoners, and that your best hope is to abandon your quest to become his servant, cleaning up whatever mess he leaves behind after the violent battles and large orgies he has every day. Once again, fight his alluring aura to shout the question one last time. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Now the warrior-king will grow silent and look you in the eye. If he deems you unworthy of his true, honest answer, then he will cripple you on the spot and seal you in his palace to be his waste-cleaner for the rest of eternity. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you are worthy, however, the warrior-king will tell you, softly, why he fears Him, and why he fears the Gathering. What he tells you will fill you with terror to the very core of your being, for anything dreaded even by this fearless and powerful warrior-king is beyond human comprehension. Many fall into insanity upon hearing the warrior-king\'s true answer, and others beg him for a swift death. If you maintain your sanity and will to live, however, then a sudden gust of wind will blow through the hall, dissolving the warrior-king\'s throne room into nothingness. You will fall into a void for a few moments before finding yourself suddenly standing in front of the institution\'s front desk. The visibly annoyed worker will be holding one of the ankle braces that confined the warrior-king\'s concubines to his throne. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That ankle brace is Object 137 of 538.

(138, 'The Holder of Denial', 'I\'ve worked in halfway houses and mental institutions all over the country, in countless cities and towns. The work isn\'t bad and it pays a bit better than most menial jobs I\'ve held. I try to be a good girl, to be kind and polite to others, but my job has affected me. To help the sick and broken you need to harden your heart and accept unpleasant truths about people. Accept that some addicts don\'t want to get clean. That what seems like compassion can sometimes be indulging the delusions of the mad, and that some people really do need to be restrained for their own good.\r\n<br> \r\n<br>I won\'t say the name or location of the place I work now, only that I\'ve been here for a long time. When I was first hired the pay was low and the hours were short and I was not in a position to complain. I\'d been working reception for a week or two when a man came in, walked with purpose to my desk and asked to see The Holder of Denial. A look of confusion must have come over my face, because he grew suddenly impatient. He screamed at me and I flinched, he banged his fist on the desk and insisted that he see The Holder of Denial. I was still trying to calm him down when my supervisor came forward. Mr. Musil took one look at the man and the man fell silent. Mr. Musil nodded to me, said \"it\'s all right,\" and led the man down a hallway that I must have passed a hundred times without ever noticing. The man glanced back at me with a grim smile on his face. I glared at him, there was no excuse for rudeness like that and I was irritated that he\'d calmed down so quickly for my supervisor. It had made me look incompetent.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Others came after him, all demanding to see the Holder of Denial, all screaming and making a scene only to calm down once Mr. Musil arrived to take them away. I walked after them once or twice, just out of curiosity, just to see what they were doing. Each time, Mr. Musil led them through a door, locked them in and walked away. He smiled at me when we passed each other. Once he left the key in the lock behind him and I nearly used it to open the door. But when my hand touched the key I felt a sick sense of guilt, a hard chewing feeling in my gut that I\'d felt before when I knew the mess I was about to be punished for was my fault and my fault alone. I pulled the key out and returned it to Mr. Musil\'s desk. He\'d left early that evening. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>It wasn\'t until the next day that I heard what happened to him. How he\'d driven his car with his wife and son in it off a bridge. How the windows had been rolled down and the seatbelts buckled, and how it seemed that none of them had tried to get out of the car. They\'d all sat there while the filthy river water rushed in and drowned them. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The next time someone came demanding the Holder, I hid. I can\'t stand to be yelled at, so I ran to the back room and hoped the red-eyed, pregnant woman at the front would go away and look for her \"Holder of Denial\" elsewhere. She\'d been shouting for eight solid minutes when I went to Mr. Musil\'s desk and found the key I\'d left there. I led her to the door at the end of the hallway without the slightest feeling of unease. Though I did wonder if Mr. Musil had been in the habit of going back to let them out later in the day. He always locked the door behind them, so they surely weren\'t getting out on their own. There must have been some other exits they were using. That seemed likely.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>I didn\'t worry about it.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>After the pregnant woman, the next person to ask for the Holder was a young man who\'d only started his shouting when I cut him off, saying \"I\'ll only take you if you quiet down and ask me politely.\" He looked around uncertainly and repeated his request in a more civil tone. He trembled as I led him to the door, as did the next few who came to see the Holder. All were at a loss in the face of a few words that they hadn\'t expected. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>From then on I took care of the sad-eyed, determined ones who asked to see the Holder. They were mostly men but there were a lot of women too. Almost all of them wore a dry, haunted look on their faces, and the few who didn\'t smiled so brightly that they frightened me. I took the ones who wore piles of rags and the ones who wore tailored suits. I took the ones with scars and tattoos, with long beards and tight smiles, with pale skin and dark skin and veins that bulged at the surface. None of them came back. I felt such tenderness towards the quiet, broken-looking ones. With them I felt like a mother putting a sick child to bed. The arrogant, cruel-eyed ones I sent through the door laughing inside, feeling an inexplicable, mean satisfaction. For the life of me I couldn\'t tell you why; after all they\'d asked to go through that door, hadn\'t they?\r\n<br>\r\n<br>I must make it sound as if these people come in every day, but that\'s only because they\'ve blurred together over the years. Really, they arrive occasionally and randomly. Sometimes months will go by without one arriving and then two will come on the same day, just hours apart. I\'ve only seen a lot of them because I\'ve been here a long time. The bad habits that used to keep me from holding down a jobâ€”tardiness, absentmindedness, my tendency to slip out the back and sneak secret joints that led to the absentmindedness...none of these things bothered anybody so long as I kept leading the Seekers to the door. I took longer hours. People covered for my mistakes and started looking at me strangely, the way I used to look at Mr. Musil.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>By and by I began to feel a nagging doubt. I wondered; what if there was no second door, no exit for that room? I\'d never seen anything but darkness inside, never taken more than a second\'s accidental look. How big could it possibly be? All those people going in and never coming out, it must have begun to get crowded in there. It might be better if fewer people ever entered the door. Around the time I started entertaining these thoughts I began to notice a button under the front desk. I don\'t know if it had been there before, hard and jeweled and amber colored, but if I pressed it when a Seeker came the lights in the room would flicker and go bright. And while I was blinded I\'d feel something soft move past me and smell something foul, and when the lights returned to normal the Seeker was always gone. Sometimes they\'d leave a tear in the carpet or a dark stain which I had to clean, but at least I didn\'t have to send them all down the hallway.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>I pressed the button on the Seekers who hadn\'t learned that I value politeness and on those that didn\'t ask politely enough. When I saw something smirking and contemptuous in the Seeker\'s eyes I would press the button hard enough to break the skin of my palm. I began to take comfort in cleanliness of light and the muffled cries that sounded like songs. I took any excuse I could to press the button and not send a Seeker down the hall. Those I did send still didn\'t return. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Until one day, when one man did return. I didn\'t like him from the moment he entered, with his sharp suit and sharp smile and empty, empty eyes. I went for the button before he reached the desk, but something stopped my hand. He nodded and asked me, very politely, to see the Holder of Denial. Some people I lead to the Holder tremble with visible fear, others hide it, and a very small number seem to be able to suppress it. But this man simply lacked it, the way a story might lack a proper ending. It chilled me. I was relieved to send him through the door. He gave me a too-wide smile and a wink, and disappeared into darkness. I locked him in, stumbled outside and smoked until a thin excuse for calm returned to me, then I went back to my desk and pretended to busy myself with paperwork. I heard footsteps coming down the hallway that I must have walked down a hundred times without hesitating on, and the man with empty eyes came out. He was carrying something in his hands. Something covered in hair or perhaps made of hair, long wet strands of hair that trailed down through his fingers. I tried to press the button that would bring the clean, white light, the light that was pure and that would cover this ugliness. He stopped me. He moved faster than my eye could follow and stopped me, keeping my hand held in his, grinning a devil smile and clucking his tongue. His grin was too wide. I was sure it would swallow me up.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Terrified, I only asked one question: \"What are you going to do to me?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>I thought he would kill me. What he did was much worse, he explained things to me. He told me what had happened to each person I had sent down the hallway. Told me in great detail the tests they had failed and the tortures they had suffered. He told me what happened to Seekers under the blinding light that kept me from seeing the things that set on them, that tore them apart and dragged them into the white-hot filament of each light bulb. He told me about the thing I had been helping to guard, and the thing that helped me guard it. He made me see what I had done.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>He left. I didn\'t. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Seekers still come asking for The Holder of Denial. Some I send down the hall, some I press the button on. I don\'t know if there\'s anything there for them to seek anymore. No others have ever come back. I try to be a good girl, kind and polite to others, but my job has affected me.

(140, 'The Holder of Forsaken Reality', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to.  When you reach the front desk, ask the receptionist if they are able to comprehend the reality.  The receptionist should look at you with a shocked expression, and back away very quickly.  They will press themselves against the wall opposite to the counter, shaking in fear.  You will be unable to move as the wall cracks, splinters, and finally shatters.  The receptionist will fall through, screaming.  Once you feel you are ready, make your way to the opening.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>At the precipice, you will see that the space beyond the wall is a massive drop.  At the bottom will wait monstrosities the likes of which plague your imagination when you sleep, the kinds that you do not even remember because carrying them in your mind would reduce you to a gibbering wreck.  The horrifying screams of these creatures will make you want to tear out your eardrums, to excise your very nerves, but you must fight to retain control of yourself.  Your task is simple, yet nigh-insurmountable for many:  You must step off the edge.  However, you must completely block from your senses these terrors that wait for you.  Close your eyes, cover your ears, do whatever you have to do to keep yourself from thinking about them.  If you are successful, you will not fall, but your feet will strike solid ground.

Know now that this is not any sort of magic, nor is it illusion; it is actually scientifically possible for fire to burn downward.  How this is possible has been lost to all, and it is one of the two secrets that only the Holder knows.  However, as you stand there, you will begin to realize how it is possible.  At this point, you must fight with all your strength against this revelation.  You must once again block your mind from the realization of how fire can burn downward.  This is forbidden knowledge, and if you were to learn it, you would become the next Holder, depravedly waiting for the next unfortunate soul to pass the secret down to before your painful demise.  \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must fight these thoughts for an indeterminate amount of time until the torch goes out.  At that point, you must call out into the darkness, â€œWhy are They denied?â€  As you stand, you will be assaulted by visions of people who denied reality in order to escape it.  Every rejection of the truth from simple ignorance to denial to extreme schizophrenia will be laid open, laid painfully bare for you to see.  It will be far, far worse than it sounds, for you will also realize what could have happened had they not ignored the truth.

However, it is obvious that this number is an incredibly important part, as important as any counting number, and you will realize that its existence renders practically all mathematical algorithms used today useless.  Second, this number can only be written on one surface at a time.  If it is written on two, the surface that it was written on less recently will be destroyed in a seemingly random chain of events.  Third, thoughts of this number will never leave your mind.  You will be endlessly thinking of this number, dismantling and reassembling modern mathematics in an effort to correct what you now know is a gigantic mistake.  If you are not able to keep your thoughts from this number, you will eventually descend into madness, forever seeking the truth and never finding it.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Whatever surface the number is written on is Object 140 of 538.

Don\'t dwell too long on these; there are two thousand of them, and if you stop to satisfy your curiosity, you\'ll join the other corpses in the room. You might even see one at your feet: the remains of a previous Seeker who couldn\'t resist. There\'s no way to know for sure, though; this Holder likes to tidy up every now and then. There will be reading chairs, too, larger and softer than you could have imagined possible, made of materials long gone from this world. These, too, may have corpses in them, each one hunched over a book.\r\n\r\nThere will be one bookshelf with only a few books on it, the rest scattered all over the floor in front of it or held in the dead hands of the corpses in the chairs.

It would be awfully rude to decline.\r\n\r\nAs you\'re about to put the last book in place, stop, and ask the man again: â€œAm I the one to stop Them?â€ He\'ll tell you, in maddening detail, what it will take to stop them. The sacrifice, tribute, suffering, torment, and vengeance that must be visited on mankind to keep them from coming together. Finally, he\'ll answer your question: You hold in your hands the means to stop them. If you\'ve been paying attention while reshelving the books, you\'ll have noticed that by this time you have placed five-hundred and thirty-seven on the shelf. Place the five-hundred and thirty-eighth book on the shelf, and the 538 Objects\' powers will be sealed, their special properties lost, their evil banished, and their Holders and Seekers freed.\r\n\r\nAnd there, as they say, is the rub. Because some Holders are better off imprisoned by their Objects. And quite a few Seekers won\'t be happy to find that the precious Objects they\'ve gone through so much trouble to collect are now ordinary objects. In fact, they\'ll probably be rather angry. And they\'ll definitely be on their way to the chateau.\r\n\r\nNow you have to make a choice â€“ you can leave, right now, and you might make it back to the doors you entered this world through before the swarm of enraged Holders and Seekers arrive to punish the one who\'s upturned their world. If you leave, they\'ll find only the Holder of the Seal, tear him to pieces, and rip the books off their shelves, restoring the 538 to power and returning motion to the wheels that grind the cosmos ever closer to Their reunion. You may escape with your life, but you won\'t obtain this Object.\r\n\r\nIf you truly seek to stop Them, however, then you must stay in the library. Soon, every horror ever known will arrive and throw itself against the walls, windows, roof, and foundation of the chateau. They won\'t get in right away, however; this is the Holder\'s domain, and he has some power here. He won\'t be able to last for long, though, old as he is, so you\'ll have to act quickly. Somewhere on the bookshelf is the story of this Object â€“ its Book. You must find it and read it. Be warned: the titles, pages, and labels on the shelves are all in the Language, and they\'re not in any order that makes sense to mortals. Furthermore, each Book contains the full history of its Object â€“ the full history, with every gruesome detail of every Seeker, Holder, or other being that ever came into contact with it. As you read a Book, you\'ll find yourself drawn in to the story so much that the trials of each Seeker will become yours â€“ their madness, their fear, their greed, and, more importantly, their injuries. Don\'t dwell too long on the wrong Book. Find the right Book, and read it. If you survive, the old man will vanish, and you will become acutely aware of every board, nail, wall, nook, and cranny of the chateau, every contour of every chair, shelf, and book in the library, and every word of every Book. If this doesn\'t shatter your fragile sanity, then congratulations: You are now the Holder of the Seal.\r\n\r\nThey are sealed, but Hell is coming to set them free. Keep the Books shelved for as long as you wish to stay Their hand.\r\n\r\n...If, on the other hand, you wish to claim this Object for yourself â€“ and damn the rest of eternity by doing so â€“ then simply take the Book and leave. Just don\'t take the wrong one â€“ no Holder or Seeker that is or ever was in existence will be pleased to have their every secret laid bare in your hands, and you\'d be surprised just how many would go out of their way to remove them. Hands and secrets, that is. Again, though, everything is in the Language, and you run the risk of getting lost in any Book you open to check. If you manage to find the proper Book before the Holder weakens and the legions of the damned crash through the wide window to exact their punishment, then flee out the front door. If you\'ve found the right Book, you\'ll find yourself outside the mental institution you started at, as if you\'d just burst out the front doors.\r\n\r\nAs long as you possess that Book, no Object can harm you. As long as you possess that Book, They cannot be stopped, for there will always be one Book missing from the shelves.\r\n\r\nThat Book is Object 143 of 538. You have broken the seal and scattered the pieces â€“ how long can you live with what you\'ve done?'),
(144, 'Holder of the Cost', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. Ask at the front desk to see someone who calls himself â€œThe Holder of the Cost.â€ The worker will sigh, â€“ sounding as though the weight of countless eons bore down on their shoulders â€“ wearily exit from behind the counter, and trudge towards the interior of the building. Follow them.\r\n\r\nThey\'ll make many turns and take you down many hallways â€“ more than should fit in a single building â€“ before stopping and opening a door for you. Inside will be a rotting wooden staircase down through a moist, earthen tunnel. Begin your descent; the worker will shut the door behind you, leaving you in total darkness. Even if you have a flashlight, you probably don\'t want to turn it on. Keep your hands off the walls, and walk. With every step you descend, you will feel a weight on your shoulders. The weight should very quickly become a crushing burden, and it\'s a long way down.\r\n\r\nIf you reach the bottom without being suffocated by the burden, you\'ll find that the stairs lead to an underground rotunda, a circular room with a domed ceiling. Here, too, the walls and floor will be made of dirt, dripping occasionally. That\'s not water, by the way.\r\n\r\nThe ceiling will have a small round hole in it, through which sunlight will stream down upon an ancient man sitting in a luxurious red fur chair in front of a wrought-iron table. In his hand, he clutches a plain stainless-steel kitchen knife. Even if he\'s awake, he\'ll be too weak to offer any resistance as you take it from his scarred hands and slit his throat.\r\n\r\nYou may feel a stinging sensation across your own throat as you do so; take a look in the full-length mirror across from where the man died, and you may notice a thin cut along your throat healing over, if you\'re fast enough. Steady yourself against the frame as a wave of dizziness washes over you.\r\n\r\nIf the old man had been awake, you could have asked him, â€œWhat will it cost to stop Them?â€ And he would have told you just what you were getting into. The cost is high, though, so very high and so horrible to contemplate that you almost certainly would have lost your mind and ended your journey on the damp floor in front of him. Even if you hadn\'t, you certainly would not have taken the knife, having known. When the dizziness passes, remove the mirror from the wall and ascend the staircase behind it.\r\n\r\nThat knife is Object 144 of 538. It will cut anything, but with every use, you will feel its bite.\r\n'),
(145, 'Holder of the Harvest', 'In any city, in any country, go to any morgue you can get yourself into. Walk up to the front desk and ask if you can visit someone who calls himself the â€œHolder of the Harvest.â€\r\n\r\nThe workerâ€™s expression should turn to a cold, impassive one, an expression so chilling youâ€™d be sure you were looking at a corpse. You will be transfixed by his eyes, unable to look away while millennia-old messages of death and despair burn themselves into your mind. At this point, you must not under any circumstances break eye contact with the worker, for if you do, you risk becoming part of this message of the damned.\r\n\r\nThis ordeal will last for what seems like centuries, but as these images drill into your mind, you must keep alert; if you are sharp enough to keep your wits, you will notice that while the workerâ€™s eyes are sternly riveted to yours, his soul will stand up and leave his body. Breaking eye contact while this happens will grant you eternal damnation - to safely break the infernal bond between your eyes and those of his body, you must muster your courage and strength to shout out, â€œItâ€™s not yet my turn!â€\r\n\r\nShould the visions and images continue, you will soon join them, as your body experiences excruciating pain, your mind finally giving way to the madness that youâ€™ve felt for so long.\r\n\r\nIf the visions stop, however, then look for the workerâ€™s specter and follow him. The ghost should pass through a wall; follow him and you, too, will pass through that wall. The area beyond will be similar to a museum exhibition, but these exhibits are ghastly figures - displays of war and disease, moving images of murders and rapes, mothers wailing over their dead sons, fathers mutilating themselves over their raped and murdered daughters. These figures of unrelenting horrors line the walls, ceilings and the floor. Make sure you are directly behind the ghost - if you stray from his path, you will become part of the exhibits for all eternity.\r\n\r\nSoon, the ghost will again pass through a door. This time, you must not follow as you did before. There is no turning back now. On this door is a relief of a little girl, peacefully kneeling down as if in prayer, your first image of peace amidst this museum of death. (Say hello to your new dwelling, should you see any other relief other than the one described.) If the relief you see is the little girl, steel yourself and open the door.\r\n\r\nYou will find yourself in a wheat field. In the middle will be a black-robed figure gracefully dancing. Upon closer inspection, you see that he is actually holding a huge scythe, slashing it about and cutting off stalks of wheat as he goes along. The figure wields it with skill attainable only with centuries, if not millennia, of practice. Every slashed stalk of wheat secretes a liquid â€“ fresh blood. Listen closely enough, and you will hear cries of unspeakable pain coming from the severed stalks.\r\n\r\nWhen he turns to your direction, he will be surprised to see a living entity in his world. Before he decides to add you to his ever growing collection of souls, you must ask one and only one question: â€œWhere are the workers in this field?â€ After you ask this, he will again start dancing while laughing wildly, and he will narrate a story that predates the earth itself: the story of how death came to be. Many go mad at this information, as death was not the simple phenomenon one might think. He will then tell you a secret that only the ancients know: the truth about death.\r\n\r\nIf you did not go mad after all of this, the robed creature will stop dancing, strike his huge scythe down on the ground, and say, â€œI know what to do with you in time.â€ Give a respectful nod and close your eyes. You will then feel a burning feeling in your chest, as if you were being stabbed. Do not open your eyes, as this is your final test. The pain will start spreading throughout your entire body, you will feel as if you\'re at the brink of death, you will hear crying around you, and it will irritate you and you will want to stop it. You can give in to the pain if you want to, but if you are resilient, you will see yourself in the wheat field with the robed creature\'s scythe jutting out of the ground. Take it and start hacking away at everything you see, and do not stop until the pain in your body goes away.\r\n\r\nWhen you are finished, you will realize that the stalks of wheat that you cut down in your frenzied state were actually every person you have ever loved. Feel no remorse, nothing whatsoever, for if you do, the robed creature will mow you down without hesitation. Find the head of the person you love most, and strike it with the scythe you wield. You will be overcome by the darkness coming out of the point of impact.\r\n\r\nWhen you wake up, you\'ll be at your local cemetery, and a funeral will be taking place nearby. Beside you will be the scythe wielded by the robed creature. Take it.\r\n\r\nThat scythe is Object 145 of 538. The harvest is coming and the workers are few.\r\n');

This macabre tale will take hours to finish, but do not be impatient, for the being\'s raspy voice is what keeps your pursuers at bay.

Be sure to kneel as soon as you can see her silhouette; her punishments for disrespect have been known to be... somewhat extreme.\r\n\r\nAs she walks toward you, the ground beneath her feet will turn into the same stone that the tower seems to be built from. She will speak to you, talking of the most ambitious architectural endeavors in human history; stories that will make your mind consider things you previously thought to be impossible. The ideas you conceive now could destroy your mind, dragging it block by block into realms of fantasy and interminable speculation, if you don\'t have the strength of will to bring yourself back to reality.\r\n\r\nAfter what seems like days of kneeling, she will mention the Tower. If you have not confronted the Holder of the Tower, you will feel a crushing blow to the back of your head. Your brains will be forced out the front of your face, and you\'ll feel every tear in your flesh, every fracture in your skull, and every ripped muscle and tendon.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, you have obtained the knowledge of the Tower where they were separated, stand up immediately and spin around. A statue, one in the exact likeness of the woman who spoke of the Tower, will be there, its stone fists raised to bash your brains out of your skull. This is the true Holder of Structure. Stare into its eyes, and demand, in a voice that could shake the foundations of Heaven itself, \"From what material were they originally created?\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the words leave your mouth, the statue will emit a scream that shatters the modern glass in the ancient stone monolith. Do not flinch, and do not cover your ears, lest every shard of diamond-hard glass home in on you and skewer you. When the scream ends, a final spear-shaped shard of glass will pierce the flesh-and-bone woman that stands behind you. She will die without a sound, standing up. The statue in front of you will crumble, her body turned to dust, except for a fist-sized dull red stone, cut with thousands of facets.\r\n\r\nThat false gem is Object 153 of 538.

If there are less than eight patrons currently there, then have a seat at the second to last stool, up at the bar. Should the bartender speak to you in an accent that sounds Russian, or Greek, order as much as you want of anything, for the Holder is aware of who you are, and you have until dawn to enjoy a comparatively painless existence.\r\n\r\nIf, however, he or she speaks to you with an accent that sounds like nothing you\'ve heard before, say, word for word, \"I would like to partake of your finest absinthe.\" Without hesitation and without breaking eye contact, the bartender will reach down and retrieve an old, dusty bottle of bright, fluorescent green liquid. Without waiting for the customary spoon, or even a shot glass, you must break off the neck and drink the entire supply. As soon as the last mouthful of viscous liquid oozes down your throat, your vision will swim, and you\'ll feel yourself falling from your seat. Make no attempt to catch yourself. Any grab at the bar will change it to a rack of torture so horrible as to defy imagination, and you will become its next victim.\r\n\r\nIf you are good at following instructions, you\'ll fall for what feels like hours, before finally coming to rest in a bar that looks like an exact copy of the one you fell from -- but with every wooden surface replaced with rusty, gore-splattered corrugated iron. Stand, and the bar will be flooded with a light that cycles through the entire visible spectrum. After the seventh cycle, sit back down upon the same stool you sat in before. In a voice that would make even a demonic entity think twice about bothering you, say, as if muttering to yourself, \"I\'ve only come for a drink. Leave me in peace.\"\r\n\r\nA man dressed in a black satin suit and wearing a black bowler hat will then enter through the door. As he sits down, the bartender from above, now missing a face, will appear and immediately pour the man a drink. Look not at what is pouring from the bottle, lest your blood emulate that liquid and drain from every orifice of your body.\r\n\r\nWait for the man to finish his drink. When he sets it down with a sigh, he will move as if to stand. Before he finishes, say, in a dark tone, \"I seek the Holder of Muse.\" Should he continue to leave, you can enjoy an eternity in which every one of your bodily fluids is served as a drink in this demonic tavern.\r\n\r\nIf the Holder remains seated, he will emit another sigh. From his mouth will emerge the most amazing, the most horrible, the most awe-inspiring, and the most soul-devouring creations and ideas ever thought of in this reality. Listen to them all, and do not interrupt him. When his infinite breath runs out, turn and ask him, \"What is the source of their inspiration?\"\r\n\r\nThe man will smile and wink at you. From his eye will shine a beam of deepest black and purest white. That beam shall pierce through your eyes, striking your mind.\r\n\r\nYour new inspiration is Object 155 of 538.

Answer truthfully, and then ask him again. He will nod and lead you to a hatch in the floor made of fine oak that shouldn\'t be there. He will pull a ring of keys and unlock the hatch. He will motion you in, but will not follow.\r\n\r\nUpon entering the hatch, you will be in a very narrow hallway. Proceed down the hallway until you find a small door made from human flesh. Knock once. If you hear a very small child whisper to you, \"You may enter,\" speak very clearly: \"I only wish to talk.\" If you have been deemed worthy, the door will slowly melt, revealing a small grassy field with a campfire in the middle.\r\n\r\nWalk to the fire. The small child will whisper to you again, but a different message: \"How long will you be staying?\" Do not answer. Instead, look into the fire and do not look away. You will feel small arms wrap around your waist. \"Are you my daddy?\" the voice will whisper again. Answer with only \"No,\" unless you wish to die a most unspeakable death.\r\n\r\nThe child will then let go, and the area around you will begin to shift; close your eyes while this happens, because as the rooms shift, you will be able to see into the abyss, and that will drive you to the brink of insanity, if not over the edge. When the room is done shifting, you will hear the hammering of metal; you may open your eyes. There will be a circle of nine shields. Each one has a different symbol of an unearthly language.\r\n\r\nThe child will then appear before you, naked and bloody. The child will point to the closest shield and nod. Do not make a move. Simply ask, \"Is there any escape?\" If the child laughs at you, dispatch him quickly. If the child cries, pray your death is a quick one.\r\n\r\nOnce the child is dead, a small dagger will appear behind you. Take the dagger and skin the child, then take the closest shield and lay it on the skinned remains. If nothing happens, place the shield back until you have found the right shield. You will know when you have.\r\n\r\nWhen you are in possession of the correct shield, speak loudly and clearly. \"I am the Challenger!\" A great statue of a man in black armor holding a shield will appear before you; bow to it. If you are again worthy, he will bow back. He will pull out his mighty sword and bring it down upon you. Put up the shield. Do not let your thoughts slip into doubt; have faith that the shield will not falter.\r\n\r\nIf you manage to deflect the blow that would end your life, the shield and sword will crumble. The statue will bow once more, and offer you his own shield as compensation. Bow, and then take the shield. A door of light will appear above you. Pull yourself out.\r\n\r\nThe shield is Object 156 of 538. There are things more dangerous than a sword.\r\n'),
(157, 'The Holder of Mercy', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Mercy.\" The worker will close his eyes and mumble something unintelligible and barely audible, drumming a short beat on the counter as he does so. Then he will gesture to the counter with his right hand, and open his eyes. Reach out with your open palm and the worker will press into it a small brass gear, the size of a dime. Turn away immediately and head back the way you came. Keep your eyes forward, do not look to the side or turn your head, and push the front door open with the hand holding the gear. If you do not follow these instructions exactly, you will suddenly find yourself outside, some distance from the facility, and any attempt to access a Holder thereafter will result in your death.\r\n\r\nIf you are successful in your task, when you open the front door, you will see a child before you, with a bandage over her right eye and a cast on her right arm. She will ask you, in the sweetest voice, if you could help her. Ignore her, and stand still, keeping your eyes on hers. She will ask you a second time, louder, if you could help. If your silence continues, she will become distraught, and plead again with you to help. There will be a single, echoing crack, and her left arm will snap, rent in two by some unseen force. The girl will scream in agony, clutching the useless, bleeding limb, and ask frantically for your help. Stay quiet, and do not let your face show the slightest trace of sympathy, or you will very much regret it.\r\n\r\nIf you remain indifferent, her legs will split open, spilling shards of bone and ropes of muscle upon the pavement as she renews her horrible screams, bleeding profusely. Slowly, she will stagger forward, though she should not even be able to stand, and call out again as she did before. Do not move or speak. Show no emotion whatsoever. If you manage to control yourself despite the horrifying sight of the girl\'s broken body, she will reach you, stretching out her shaking, blood-splattered right arm, tears streaming down her face.\r\n\r\nTake her hand, and twist it as hard as you can. You will hear a sickening, wet tearing sound, and the girl will gasp in terror and pain, unable to accept your betrayal. Stare straight into her left eye, and speak these words: \"You have not yet begun to feel.\" Blackness will consume your vision, and the feel of the girl\'s touch will vanish. The faint sound of her sobbing will fade behind you, and you will see a hallway, stark white and brightly lit. There will be a door at the end, with a single steel plate bolted to the front as its only feature. Walk towards it quickly, but don\'t run. You don\'t want to attract attention.\r\n\r\nSoon enough, you will reach the door, and all lights save for the one directly above will shatter in a shower of sparks. Read the words etched into the plate, and remember them, for you will need them to escape. When you are satisfied with your memory, touch the door, and gently ease it open. Before you will stand a man in a long white coat, his face obscured by shadow. Approach him, and he will hold up his hands when you have come close enough.\r\n\r\nOpen your palm to show you have the gear, and the man will nod, lowering his arms. Say this, and only this: \"When did they become the first?\" The man will laugh, and tell you a story of incredible atrocities, recounting for you the history of the first Objects, and the destruction that they wrought on the far-flung world that contained them. The knowledge itself is anathema to our very reality, and could easily tear your mind to shreds if you fail to comprehend it.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the tale, the man will hold out his left arm, its flesh riddled with arcane symbols, unknown words, and other carvings. Around his wrist will be a watch, extremely old and no longer working. Take it from him, and whisper the words carved into the door. If your memory is perfect, you will find yourself at the front desk of the mental institution that you used for this journey. If it is not, you will be privileged to witness firsthand the power of the first Objects, for as long as your soul exists.\r\n\r\nIf you have survived, you may exit the facility with no lasting ill effects. The watch is yours to keep. Wear it, and you will always be on time. Your train will never be late, your flight will never be delayed, and no earthly circumstance will keep you from your appointments. Press the brass gear into the center of the watch, and you will never age, nor will your body show your years.\r\n\r\nBut beware: as long as the watch adorns your wrist, your perception of time will begin to slow. Seconds will grow into minutes and hours to days, and if the gear is ever removed, your true age will return to you ten times over. Make use of it carefully, and never under any condition let the Objects be reunited.\r\n\r\nThe Watch is Object 157 of 538. You would be wise to fear the time it keeps.'),

The worker will open it for you. Once you descend, there\'s no going back.\r\n\r\nThe trapdoor leads to a stony labyrinth -- one devoid of windows, and filled with the kind of golden-brown dusty light one might see in an attic in the afternoon. Don\'t dwell too long on the light; stay alert, and search for the Holder, as he is already searching for you.\r\n\r\nHe is a hulking, twelve-foot-or-taller beast with the body and legs of a man, but the head and feet of a bull. You won\'t be able to see him until he wants you to, and he doesn\'t like his prey to see him until it\'s too late. Keep your wits about you; if yo do not defeat this Holder, you shall become his next meal.\r\n\r\nNo matter how skilled or unskilled you are at combat, if you manage to fend off the beast\'s initial blow, the two of you will be evenly matched thereafter. Continue your battle, and when you are ready for it to end, ask the beast, â€œWhere is it safe?â€ Upon hearing this, he will pause for the briefest of moments, giving you an opportunity to strike before he responds. Attack; if you let him give his answer, you will find yourself horribly outmatched when the fight resumes.\r\n\r\nYou cannot kill this beast -- not permanently, anyway. Time will eventually heal all wounds that you inflict, but you can strike him down for long enough to take what you have come for. Assuming you manage to render the Holder inert, approach his body and check the hand that wasn\'t carrying the axe. It ought to be tightly clenching a Thumbtack. If not, you\'ll have to search the ground around where you fought.\r\n\r\nStick the Thumbtack into something, and the stuck item will be hidden from all you wish to hide it from.\r\n\r\nThe Thumbtack is Object 158 of 538.

Should anything happen to <i>you</i>, however, the cat will merely laugh.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Your task is to keep that cat alive until midnight, one week after receiving the box. This will prove difficult, as the cat will try to end your life in every way it can, and it will happily endanger its own to do so. It is unnaturally cunning and will try everything it can think of to lure you into your own death. As the week passes, these traps and plots will become more ingenious and harder to thwart, and you will need all of your wits and strength if you are to even have a hope of survival.

Defend yourself -- without harming the cat -- until midnight.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The cat will scream, \"<i>Why won\'t you die</i>?\" You must answer, \"Because I am not a traitor.\" If you give the answer without fear or hesitation, the cat will cease its struggles, look you in the eye, and say, \"Then you will learn.\" It will scratch your hands and flee, vanishing as it leaves your sight.

Don\'t speak or share eye contact with anyone, or their words and gaze will haunt you and rend your mind asunder. If the worker flinches and nods three times, however, follow her. She will lead you down a clean and brightly lit hallway, with closed doors lining the walls. Each door will be painted a bright color and adorned with a three digit number, and through each, you will hear voices mumbling. Eventually, the worker will stop at a specific door.\r\n\r\nIf the door is yellow and has a number that ends in 6, demand that she take you to the true door. If she stops at a blue door whose number ends in 9, ask in a calm voice, \"May you show me inside?\" If the worker refuses, then bow to her politely and leave, traveling the same path you took to get here.

Standing in front of you is a visible man, the bright light glowing from inside him illuminating his organs and visceral features. He will motion for you to follow him.

She gives off a grandmotherly vibe and as soon as you meet her gaze, she smiles warmly at you and motions for you sit down. Now you must take a chair from the table and place it one foot in front of the rocking chair. Sit in it so that you are facing the woman and her gaze meets your own.\r\n\r\nDo not attempt to converse with the old woman. If you do, she will eventually fall asleep, and you will find yourself frozen in place, forever. Instead, look directly into the old woman\'s eyes and ask, \"Why does He see Them yet not believe Them?\"\r\n\r\nAfter being asked this, the woman will begin to to weave a tale. She speaks of all things unknown and dark. She whispers about the things man sees in his nightmares and catches out of the corner of his eye. She tells you of the touch you feel when you are alone and she laughs at the way man flinches as he reacts to the visions of his own imagining. At this moment, your chair will be hit with a shocking force from behind. Do not cry out or turn around to face the source, or the old woman\'s shape will melt away to reveal a pale and sickly Thing with large melancholy jaws. The Thing will scratch the flesh from your bones and maul you until you shuffle off your mortal coil. Ignore the blow and the woman will continue to smile. She will reach into her blouse pocket and take out a pair of glasses. She cleans them with a cloth before putting them on. She looks at you with them on, laughs once more, removes them, and hands them to you.

Do not think about the Attendant, as he is beyond anyone\'s help now.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you walk down the long hallway, you will see doors appear on either side of you containing surgical suites. Nurses and doctors with pale, contorted and eyeless faces surgically mutilating patients that might have once been human but barely resemble them now. The patients, screaming, in pieces, in elaborate bondage and decaying on the operating tables are so gruesome that it will be difficult to look away. Nevertheless, you must <i>not</i> allow your eyes to linger on the patients, the doctors or anything in these rooms or you will become one of these unfortunate patients, one of these failed Seekers, your suffering eternal and more acute than the deaths of a thousand cancer patients.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you feel yourself being sucked by an invisible source into one of the rooms, all hope is already lost.

Thousands of worms, centipedes, millipedes, maggots, earwigs, silverfish and countless other unidentifiable creatures will cover her and she will raise her purulent head and open her eyes to reveal parasitic worms wriggling under the membranes. Other insects will cover you and you must not react in any way. She will reach out her arm of thousands of scribbling legs and touch your face with its thousands of slimy feelers, legs and antennae. If you show the slightest sign of discomfort or disgust you will be condemned to rot here for eternity, fed on by vermin and fully conscious. You must only ask \"How long will you rot?\" and she will open her mouth as wide as your head revealing thousands of red centipedes. You must now keep your eyes open from here on in.

She will take your head in her giant, black maw of a mouth and inside you will hear an agonizingly long tale of decay while the centipedes nibble your flesh, crawl into your mouth, nose and ears and their sharp little legs scrape your eyeballs. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When she is finished, she will release you from her maw and you will be permitted to search under all the insects and decay for the Object.

Unless you wish to abandon your quest, do not let yourself be enticed into any of those rooms, for the voices your hear and the hands you feel are indeed female, but not human, and the pleasures they promise are not given free of charge, but for a price no man is prepared to pay.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Finally, you\'ll find yourself at the end of the hall before a thick curtain, the person who lead you here, nowhere to be found.

As your eyes grow accustomed to the candlelit twilight and your senses numb with the thick incense in the room, you\'ll be able to distinguish the shape of a woman laying lazily on cushions in the far end of the room, her face totally covered by a veil. She\'ll signal you to get closer with a seductive movement of her finger and you must approach her with no doubts in your mind.

If done correctly, as you mate with her, your mind will be presented with unspeakable visions from long lost times of corrupt worship and forbidden cults while an unholy pleasure quakes through your body. If you manage to keep your sanity until the end, a powerful orgasm will shake you out of the trance and grant you clarity of mind.

Pray this person is a man, for a woman will subject you to experiments long thought proven... unnecessary. If it is a man, he will ask you to get into an elevator. Do so and press the button for the lowest floor in the complex. When you reach this floor, do not get off or you will fall into a bottomless pit. Instead, wait on the elevator for the lights on the buttons to turn red, and the elevator will descend six more floors. When it stops this time, wait for the scientist to get out before doing so yourself. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The scientist will lead you down a sterilized hallway filled with glass panels on each wall. Through these panels you will see people performing experiments, not unusual for a laboratory. What is odd here is that as you walk down the hall, the experiments you will see become increasingly primitive. You will see people attempting to prove the existence of black holes and you will see people trying to prove the earth goes around the sun. You will see those who split the atom and those who studied the stars to build the pyramids. Also, as typical of these adventures, do not be surprised to see a demon or two walking down the hall. If you see a demon, acknowledge him with a wink or a nod; the inhabitants of this hall do not like to be ignored.

Sitting at a desk in the middle of the room is a small, bespectacled man in a lab coat, scribbling names, dates, numbers, and results of experiments into a diary at blinding speed. Wait for this small man to notice you before you say anything. He will ask you, \"Have you met my colleague, the <a href=\"?Holder_of_Science\" class=\"yespage\">Holder of Science</a>?\" This is a trap.

Instead, produce an Object. Any Object will do. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>At the sight of an Object, one of the tanks on the wall will shatter, revealing an enormous monster. It should be humanoid in shape, but with horns, four arms (three small, one impossibly huge), and a bulk no human could possibly possess. It will have five eyes, all strewn about its face in a mad manner, and vicious, curved teeth. One leg will be thin and spindly but still muscular, the other will be swallowed up in a mound of flesh. If this is the monster you see, you are safe. If it is any other, be prepared to take his place in the tank. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The correct monster will slash the small man\'s throat with his largest arm, then throw his corpse out the window.

Once inside, find the head custodian and ask to see \"The Holder of the Ethereal.\" He\'ll blink a few times, as if unsure if what you asked was real. Ask him again so it sinks in. Should he continue to stare and blink, you may wish to close your eyes and hold your ears shut before witnessing your innards being chewed apart by Hell\'s starving demons. However, if he should shake his head and turn to leave, go ahead and let him walk off, as it means your request was granted. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>At this point, all you can do is wait. You\'ll notice the room getting darker and darker very, very slowly, but you can\'t be sure until some time has passed. As this is happening, the faint, nearly inaudible sounds of a tune will begin to play. This sound will grow louder and louder very, very slowly. <i>Do not</i>, however, strain to listen, for this will cause it to vanish and your ears to be ripped from your head. You must treat it as a background noise and nothing more, even though it will be the most beautiful song you\'ve ever heard. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Soon, a low chorus of singing will rise to join in with the song. The lyrics these voices sing are the most foul of any you will ever encounter in your life, but just like the song, you must not focus on them. In heartbreakingly-beautiful melodies, they will sing about every murder, every rape, every tale of false and broken love the world has ever known. Should you focus for even a second on any of the lyrics being sung, you will encounter the misery in that lyric a hundred fold until the day you die or go mad. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After what feels like a very long time, the song will slowly fade, but the lights will continue to lower until all is pitch black with the exception of a spot a few feet ahead, inhabited by dimly-lit shadows. Don\'t look too closely into it, for you may well go mad from the sight of the creatures lurking therein. A few moments will pass, and soon an eyeless figure dressed in formal attire will appear standing within this spot, holding at his side an old, rotting cello as tall as he. He will sit in a rusty chair that gradually takes form within the shadows as well. He will sit ready to play, but will not until you ask him one question: \"Why do they sing?\" He will smile a sad smile and instead ask you, \"What did you think of my song?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When he asks you this, you <i>must</i> respond with, \"I didn\'t come just to hear old beauties.\" He will sigh and begin to play another tune, this one at once lighthearted and heavy, whimsical and heartbreaking. Whatever you do, you cannot listen to the tune he\'s playing at all, for everything will vanish in a flash and you\'ll find yourself standing in front of Satan himself, listening to his ear-shattering wails for eternity. He will speak slowly, but at length, about why they sing, about their attempts to drown out their sorrows and mournings with music. He will tell you how music is the one thing able to calm their bloodlust and their rage, even though they are doomed to sing the most horrible things imaginable. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once he finishes talking, his tune should stop as well. If it doesn\'t, your death will be quick and painless by his hands and you\'ll join in with his chorus forever. If it does stop, he will rise and pack away the cello, then turn to you and take a bow. He will then slowly fade away into nothingness, as if never really there to begin with. The cello he left behind is yours to keep. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That cello is Object 166 of 538.

Do this on the night of a full moon. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Make your way to the highest point in the cemetery and, keeping an eye on your watch, wait for midnight. When the time comes, stand up and say, â€˜Deliver me unto the Holder of Zealâ€™. Upon saying these words, the full moon will wane into darkness, rendering your surroundings without light, except for one grave, which will glow with wan paleness. Take your supplies and go towards it. The headstone will read â€˜The Holder Of Zealâ€™, along with the epitaph, â€˜Through devotion all things are possibleâ€™. Start digging up the dirt in front of the headstone, and do not stop until you have completely unearthed the coffin sealed below. Open the lid of the sarcophagus â€“ it should lift easily enough â€“ and note that it contains no body, or indeed anything but total darkness. Now is your last chance to back out. Any further, and the only way out of this will be to see it through to the end.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Now, divest yourself of everything but the Holderâ€™s object and the compass â€“ any light sources will sabotage your continued efforts now, and all other things will merely by an encumbrance. Orient your compass precisely west, and position yourself in the pit so that you face the same direction as the arrow. You should be facing the right side of the open casket. Step forward and carefully lower yourself into the coffin. The drop will take a few seconds, but the landing will be painless. The darkness here is total, but through touching your surroundings you will discern that you are in a stone walled corridor, its span roughly 8 feet.

Dead things, alien things, abominable things, all knitted together into twin loathsome tableaus that shall be your only companions on this stygian path. Chilling insinuations and unsane secrets shall be whispered, wrathful oaths snarled, dire shrieks howled â€“ amongst a cacophony of less recognisable noise. To see these fused monstrosities in any light would shock you to your core, petrifying you long enough for shapeless limbs to tear you to pieces, adding your bloody remains to their composite bodies.

So, to repeat, do not look up from the compass, do not veer from the corridorâ€™s centre, and do not slow.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>In time, the loathsome babble will fall behind you. When it ceases entirely, look up.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will now be in an alcove not much wider than the corridor you just left. The walls are stone once more, and affixed to them in several places are lanterns burning with an eerie green light. The floor is divided into non-Euclidean shaped tiles surrounding an octagonal dais. On the dais is the statue of a long forgotten deity, whose form is so horrible that none but its most devout worshippers can look upon it without succumbing to terror.

From its serpentine nostrils and lipless mouth ichor flows incessantly.

If done correctly, however, a pale, yellow liquid should come out of from the wound and you will be largely out of danger as soon as your victim has deflated and shriveled to an almost human-like shape.  \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He is now totally harmless (though still, I would not step on his fingers) and it should be safe to ask him \"Will He ever die?\"  You must listen carefully to his response as his lips will be covered by layers of shriveled skin.  His answer will be brief; when he has finished, feel free to search through the Holder\'s slime for his object.  My suggestion would be to close your mouth during your search, as well as any other orifice in your body.  You wouldn\'t want it inside of you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The parasite is Object 169 of 538.

The cashier will close their eyes for several minutes, and then stand up and lead you towards the pool.

The cashier will stop at the edge of the pool, and silently indicate for you to enter.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Completely submerge yourself in the water, so that no part of your body comes close to the pool\'s surface. Close your eyes, and keep them closed for however long it takes to mentally ready yourself. Open your eyes. If you are not ready, you will find yourself still in the pool, unable to move and rapidly running out of air. If, however, you are prepared to face the Holder, you will open your eyes to see a dark and endless stretch below you. You will gently float to the surface and take stock of your surroundings.  On the horizon, you will see an island. As you start swimming toward the island, you will notice the waters are no longer still, but moving against you with increasing strength. You must swim with all your strength against the tide, for as soon as you give way to them, you will be swept away, cursed to drift endlessly through this barren, infinite ocean.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you reach the island, you will have an almost unbearable urge to stop and rest. You must press on however, until you reach the massive lake at the center. Every muscle in your body will scream, you will feel your mind begin to collapse, but you will not be safe until you arrive at the lake. When you arrive, bend towards the lake and drink in some of the crystal waters. As soon as the liquid touches your throat, you will hear its strange voice, calling from somewhere below the surface. The words will be strange and incoherent, blurred by the leagues of water beneath which it rests. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must look firmly before you and ask \"How did it come to this?\" Its voice will suddenly become clear, its words booming out from the surface. It will describe the countless centuries through which it lived, describing how every continent in turn was consumed by the sea, how this group of rocks is the only land left on the entire planet. It will describe how it wept, constantly, for all those centuries, eventually creating this lake with its tears, and it will tell you what every tear was for, in horrid detail. It has wept for every atrocity that has been committed, every death, every lie, all contained in the endless weeping. Then it will tell you that your death will be the final tear it must cry.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must dive into the lake, swimming downward until there is no more light, until your lungs empty of air. It will try to convince you to go back, to live forever on the surface. If you ignore it, it will try to repel you, sending jets of water upwards. If you persist, you will see a glowing, shapeless form in the pitch darkness. If you are fast enough, you will reach it just as your consciousness fades, you must touch it and free it from its life.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will wake up once more in the public pool, feeling cold and exhausted. Congratulations. The holder has given you all the centuries through which it lived, centuries through which you must now live too. You will still be alive when the continents start to sink. You will still be alive when all other life forms have perished in the boiling and freezing waters. And all the time you will be weeping, weeping for your mistakes and the mistakes of all humanity.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This immortality is Object 170 of 538.

You are going to have to be totally prepared to proceed, though, if you wish to suffer no eternal damnation during your search. Your mind must be absolutely devoid of pride, and lacking in ego, for if it is not you have no possibility of defeating this Holder - leave. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If, however, you feel secure enough in your mental stability, ignore the incriminating stares of the people around you and explore the premises for the nearest building map. Memorize the room layout; you\'re looking for the one door not found in it. It will be unmarked.  \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Upon finding said door, which should look wholly inconspicuous and could appear in any hallway in the institution, slowly achieve within yourself the focus required to defeat your unmet opponent, and open the door. Walk quietly into the cell, and sit on the bloody rug at the far side of the bile-covered floor.  \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Do not forget to first shut the door, or many people on the other side will be quite upset at you for allowing your new roommate to escape. The sleeping man chained medievally to the center of the room is to be called Jim, and he is the Holder of Infinite Patience.

Any of Jim\'s victims would tell you that the last thing that they did before meeting the gnarled ends of Jim\'s fingernails was panic, after which time they were thrown eternally into a room identical to the one you are in, cold, iron chains wrapped around them as fire seeped into their cell through invisible creases, scorching their wretched bodies.  \r\n<br>\r\n<br>No, instead stare Jim straight in the eye, without moving, without thinking, without breaking eye contact.

The best strategy here is to just not be afraid of Jim, no matter how badly his hide stinks of madness and decay.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>I fervently hope that your dead stare will stop Jim from claiming his new plaything, and if it does work, and Jim becomes still, seize this moment to address him by name: \"Jim, why has He put you here?\"  \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Jim may become gripped by emotion, if your timing is correct in your questioning and his mind is sufficiently still to coherently understand your words. Painfully he will moan the story of his wrongful arrest and subsequent imprisonment, of his world taken away from him in a single, dehumanizing instant, and he will likely weep assuming he still has tear ducts by the time that you reach him.  \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Do not attempt to console the devastated man; there is nothing you could possibly do to remedy an eternity in isolated torture. Also do not attempt to end his suffering through murder; if that were an option and Jim were a mortal, it would have been ended millennia ago.

When you are ready to seek this object and after your have said your goodbyes to those worthy of them, you must sell all your earthly possessions -with the sole exception of the clothes you\'ll wear that fateful day. (Choose only the oldest and humblest of your rags for that purpose; do not layer.) Do not attempt to make a profit nor look around for the best deals: just endeavour to get rid of your mundane encumbrance as quickly as you can, for whatever sum you are offered.   \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Collect all the proceeds in cash and pack them into a plastic bag, then head for the station (on foot, don\'t you dare spend any of that money on public transport, water nor food). Wait until the ticket-selling booth is about to close and stepping in, state to the attendant that you need to go to the Holder of Detachment. The tired expression of the ticket-seller will melt into abject horror and he or she will attempt to close the booth with trembling hands while refusing to look at you. It is then that you must present your bagful of money. At its sight, the fear will give way to sudden professional composure and with a blank face and monotonous voice, the attendant will ask you: \"Is that all, sir?\" Before you can answer, though, the bag will be claimed and from an ancient-looking machine made of blackened cast iron, a big, yellowed ticket will be produced and handed wordlessly to you. As you take it, the attendant will close the booth with rather unnecessary violence.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>On the ticket you\'ll find printed the time of departure: Long after the last officially scheduled train and long before the first train of the morning next. Take a seat in the instructed platform and wait. You will not be disturbed by guards as the platform empties of the late riders going back home -to lives of contentedness the kind of which you have now renounced. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Wait and do not slumber. Wait and mind not the unnatural chill lifting from the ground as the expected time arrives, biting to your bones and against which your thin rags offer no protection. Wait and pay no attention to the clicking and rustling and hissing noises of the other \'commuters\' of this after-world train line; keep your eyes trained on the converging lines of the railway in the distance whence the train will come forth to avoid undesirable... interactions. Moreover, wait and hope against hope that you followed all these instructions correctly and that your payment was deemed true. Seven is a gross miscalculation of the number of hells, as you\'ll soon learn if an insufficient or untrue amount was paid and you were handed an incorrect ticket in exchange, instructing you to board the wrong train. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If a train stops in front of you, make sure it\'s then exactly the hour printed in the ticket and not even a minute early.

A ruin of mould and rust seemingly incapable of standing still without falling apart, let alone being rail-worthy.

Your soul shall remain chained to this now timeless platform where you will wait forever for a train that never again will come.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you step inside, pray that you boarded a completely empty carriage because otherwise I have no further advice or hope to give you; you knew the risks.

Joints aching, senses dulled by the monotonous, eternal, all-encompassing tak-tak of the wheels meeting the rails\' junctures; you\'ll wonder if you\'ve ever done anything else than sitting there, or whether existence outside the train was ever more than a dream. Then, without warning, a creaking sound will announce the opening of a carriage door behind you, followed by slow but purposeful steps towards you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>As the steps stop next to your seat, hand out your ticket without looking up. The ticket will be picked from your hand and you\'ll hear the rustle of something being scribbled on it. NEVER look up. Before you are given back your ticket, a mocking voice will ask of you, \"Are you having a pleasant trip?\" You must answer, with as much conviction as you can muster, \"Is all of this actually worth it?\" A long pause will follow while you feel a burning gaze penetrate your being, so fierce that not even the marrow of your bones could escape its scrutiny. There\'s no way to know what or how the Holder judges but from the answer you\'ll learn your fate.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If \"Yes\" is the answer, you\'ll arrive soon to the same place from whence you departed, where coming the morning you\'ll be able to claim a refund of your money just by showing your face.

You could pray for a swift death, but there won\'t be anyone listening.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you correctly remained silent, however, the attendant will ask you one more time, this time with a hint of urgency in their voice. Ignore their plea, and ask again for the Holder of Change. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The attendant will look at you with disappointment on his face, but soon enough he or she will lead you to a unused supply closet. Before the attendant leaves, lock eyes with them. If you break eye contact for so much as a blink, you will surely be devoured by the creature that led you here. It knows this, and will leave very, very, slowly. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once the attendant is gone, step into the closet and close the door; shut your eyes for exactly 5 seconds and reopen the door. You will see a small, windowless room with a young female child standing in the center of it. If there is no child, close your eyes while whispering \"Fear does not shake me.\" Once you are finished saying this reopen your eyes. If still no girl stands in the center of the room, there is no hope for your life; the girl you were looking for is the one standing behind you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once you assure the girl is there close your eyes, shut the door once again and this time wait for 3 seconds exactly. Reopen your eyes and turn the handle once again. This time the room will look decayed and heavily aged. In the center of the room will lie the corpse of an elderly lady, in her hand a revolver with 5 shells. Quietly whisper these exact words: \"What were they once?\" If said incorrectly, the door will slam behind you and the gun will vanish from her hand. You have done wrong and will spend the rest of eternity locked in a room with a rotting corpse.\r\n<br> \r\n<br>If said properly, the corpse will speak from beyond death telling you in the most disgusting and horrible way a tale from before time all the way to the current second.

With it you will receive fourteen arrows. All of them, except for one, should be fletched with yellow and white feathers. The odd one out will be fletched with black. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Proceed to fire your arrows, but do not ever use the black one. You may continue shooting well past closing time; you will not be interrupted by anyone. As night falls, nock an arrow on your string; fire it just as the last sliver of sun sinks below the horizon. No matter your skill, no matter you eyesight, the arrow will be a perfect bullseye. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>At that instant, a wave of black and violet fog will erupt from the target, and will form a ring with a diameter that encompasses seven targets, including yours. When it fades, you\'ll see that where it once sat in a wide plain, or at the edge of a forest, the range is now located at the top of a dirt-capped plateau. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>It\'s advised that you move from the middle of the range, as an arrow will be headed directly towards you. The owner of the arrow is a young woman, someone who looks to be a year younger than yourself. Her flaming red hair whips straight back as if a wind blows straight into her face. In her hands she holds a bow carved from blue wood. Over her right eye she wears a white eye patch, marked with a symbol similar to <a href=\"?Holder_of_the_Mark\" class=\"yespage\">the one on your eye</a>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>She\'ll beckon you over, and challenge you to a contest of marksmanship. How you do on your first two shots is not important. When you nock the third arrow, a large beast-like demon will vault over the edge of the plateau. Releasing the shot will fire it straight through its head. It will be a drop in the ocean, though, as the one beast will be followed by thousands of others just like it. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Before the first wave hits the ground, grab the archer around the waist, and kiss her as if it was the last thing you could do before you die; it\'s highly likely that it will be. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Time will stop. The beast demons will hang in mid air. As soon as you break contact with her, ask her, \"Who is among my allies?\" Her answer will come in the form of a story that details every shadow-cloaked assassination in human history. At the end she will take off her eye patch, and hand it to you; you\'ll see that, lodged in her right eye is a twisted iron arrow head, blood pouring from the wound as if it was fresh. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You should knock your black arrow, as she is knocking an identical, white one. Stand back to back, aiming towards the frozen mass of demons, and at the same time, fire. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The resulting white-wash explosion will knock you out, and you\'ll wake up in the bed of the place you call home. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Over your right eye will be the eye patch. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That eye patch is Object 179 of 538.

Should the mere vocalization of the name bring the feel of pleasure and fear to them, then you have come to the right place.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>They will lead you to a door previously unnoticed in the bordello, and you will descend down a flight of stairs alone. The descent will take up to ten minutes, and you will notice that the area around you will seem to grow older. Not decay, but rather seem more dated in design. The steel railing will morph to wood, the drywall will become stone, and the stairs beneath you will seem to be carved from rock.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will exit into a circular ring that seems to encompass a large cylindrical room. Should you turn around, the door you entered from will not be there. Several doors will line the inner side of the ring. You must enter the seventh from your starting position clockwise.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The interior of the room resembles a Satanic summoning chamber, and, as with most summoning chambers, a demonic presence will be felt. Ancient bones litter the ground, the walls are tinted red from millenia of bloodshed. A pentagram will be laid out in the center of the room, glowing with a fierce orange hue.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>In a carved alcove you will find a book and a dagger. No matter what page you turn the book to, you will find a single incantation. Taking the dagger in your hand you must let the blood from your body in any way you choose while reciting the incantation over the pentagram.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Should the ritual fail, I cannot help you any longer. Let it suffice to say that the bones are most definitely the remnants of Seekers who failed the ritual. Should it succeed, however, a column of flame will erupt from the pentagram. When it fades, a being will appear. Depending on who you are exactly, this creature\'s appearance will change. It may take the shape of your worst enemy, or your best love, or mentor. Regardless, it will be male if you are attracted to males, and female if you are attracted to females.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>No matter whose shape it takes, it will be very, very beautiful. Its nude body and succulent figure will taunt you with every glance. You must ignore these temptations, for submitting to the seduction of the Holder is a fate worse than death and greater than bliss itself. Pain, agony, joy, and pleasure will all meld into one feeling that will leave you paralyzed and unable to react as the being mates fiercely and passionately with you. And it will not stop until every ounce of your life force has been drained.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You may ask it only one question: \"How does it tempt us?\" The creature may answer, it may not. If it chooses not to recite the answer to you, you are not out of luck. The book will stay with you upon your return to Earth, and it will contain the answer. The dagger, however, will remain here, or to be precise, in the heart of the creature. As long as it is bound by its chains, it will not be able to harm you. Stab its heart, and release it from this plane of existence.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>It will burn and scream a scream more terrible than any other cry in the history of the universe. Even if you are an experienced Seeker, the sound may still send chills through you. Once it has completed its death, the door behind you will swing open.

None shall be denied entry to this place except for two reasons. If, in your life, you have ever given advice which is insincere, or given advice that secretly furthers your own agenda, it is unwise to approach this Holder.

If somebody denies you forgiveness then you will not be able to seek the Holder of Understanding until that person dies. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If, however, you have not violated this condition, or the other, then the attendant will nod and ask you to a take a seat.

As you wait you may still grow hungry, thirsty and experience any other bodily urges, except none of them will kill you or grow stronger than a constant irritation.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>After a length of time, which can range from seconds to days, somebody will enter from an adjoining room.

The pain you will fill is what they felt, and you will suffer the physical wounds they suffered, the ones that you were blissfully ignorant to, but the ones you caused. Others will relate their emotional torment to you, and soon you will sink into misery and agony at the weight of their torment. All their sadness, their anguish, their despair will be placed onto you. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>At the end of the ordeal, the person you have hurt the most will appear. If you still do not understand the agony that you have caused through your life, behind them the Holder will sigh, hand your victim a dagger, and they will be given the power of your salvation or damnation. If you are lucky, the capacity for understanding â€“ and thus, forgiveness â€“ will be with your victim, and they will spare you. Otherwise, you will die by a stab to the heart.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>However, if you understand the pain you have caused, but you do not care, the Holder will banish your victim and assume his true form. You may attempt to battle him if you dare, with whatever objects you have concealed from his sharp senses. It is an extremely difficult fight, and there is only a slight chance of you winning. If you do, you may take the Object from his corpse, but beware â€“ most of the other Holders fear this particular Holder, and now they fear you. Never again will you go unnoticed by them, even if you cease your quest. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>But, should you fully understand the terrible things you have done, both covertly and overtly, the Holder will send the last person away, then smile at you. This is your signal. You must tell the Holder of everything. All the suffering, the pain, the agony you have both caused and gone through in your life, ending with the pain caused to you and the pain that you, in turn, caused to others, through this quest. Do not worry, for you have passed his test, and no harm will come to you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>At the end of your tale, you must stand and ask the Holder this: â€œDo you understand?â€\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If he shakes his head sadly, you will wake up in your bed, without any memory of the Objects or your quest. Never again will you encounter them.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If he nods, you are free to leave. However, you will not receive his Object.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If he asks, â€œDo you?â€ you must step forward and embrace him. Try not to show repulsion at his touch, for his illusionary form does not extend that far.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Then, he will take a custom-made black revolver from his pocket and hand it to you. Inscribed on the barrel are the words â€œThe Widowmaker.â€ The gun holds any bullet, and it is indeed a formidable ally. This Holder understands what you have been through, and he is also your ally. In your time of need, neither he nor his gun will fail you. You may only call upon him once.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The Widowmaker is Object 186 of 538. Now that you understand the price of your actions, there is no choice of your devotion to your cause. To recant now is an insult to all those who you came across.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>There is one last thing.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The other condition for entry is that you must never have visited <a href=\"?Holder_of_the_Cosmos\" class=\"yespage\">the one who rides on horseback.</a> The Holder of Understanding and that particular Holder have a long history. However, if you take the Widowmaker with you when visiting the rider, you may yet obtain his Object.\r\n<br> <br><br>'),

Approach the front counter with a look of determination on your face.

Follow her.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The corridor will twist and turn, seemingly in impossible ways. You will notice the air will become more humid, the hall becoming brighter although no source of light is apparent. You will be shown a door, slightly ajar, and the attendant will shuffle off without a word. Push open the door, ignoring its slimy coating.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Inside this room will be a brilliant white light, as bright and as high up as the sun. The walls will be lined with a floral print, the floor will be neatly trimmed grass, and standing prominently in the center of the room is what looks like a large flower bud, about half your height.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>An elderly man will be sitting in the corner, eyes closed. He will not notice you or interact in any way, save for responding to the question \"What if it dies?\" The man will stand, walk to the plant in the center, feel for the tip of its bud, and tear off a piece.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Sound will now cease. No scream may leave your mouth, no clap of your hands will be heard - even the voice of your own thoughts will be pushed out. After a few moments, a deep vibration will enter you mind. Suddenly, like a boom of thunder, the world around you will shake and rumble, as every physical pleasure imaginable engulfs your senses. Your eyes will roll back, and you will fall to the floor writhing in orgasmic joy.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must reject these feelings, lest you will lay on the floor of that room until you die from dehydration. You must imagine only the worst pain you\'ve felt, dig your nails into your chest, scratch at yourself until you focus only on the pain. The vibrations will stop, and you will stand. Inside the tear on the flower is a seed. Take it, leave the room, and make sure to focus only on your discomfort.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The seed is Object 187 of 538.

Once you enter, do not talk to anyone, lest you find yourself under the influence of some other Object. Upon reaching the front desk, look for a brochure of a bar or a pub. If there are none, then you have failed. All your efforts up to this point has been for naught. If some can be found, take one and quietly leave.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Go to the bar and sit near the darkest corner. Place the brochure on the table and do not order a drink. Wait. Two men will walk into the bar, their appearances will vary for each Seeker. Both of them will sit at your table. Before any of them speaks, ask them \"Which of you is the Holder of The Blank Canvas?\" One of them will nod and the other will leave. </i>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>These were the instructions, and Brandon Kite the Seeker was quite unsure of the quest\'s authenticity. Still, the sixty-something bald old man before him smiled as his companion walked away. \"Well then.\" The old man finally spoke. \"Seeker, before we begin, let me warn you that there are no powers to gain, nor truths to find beyond this point.\" The old man stood up and began to walk away. \"If you continue, nothing but a heavy burden awaits you.\" He continued. \"Follow me if you remain steadfast in your quest.\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Brandon stood up and left the bar with the old man. The geezer was limping and his eyes showed glimmers of terror and despair. They betrayed the horrors that he has experienced. \"You were a Seeker. I can see it in your eyes.\" Brandon said as he hastened his steps to catch up. \"Yes.\" came the old man\'s answer. \"I was called Ferdinand Gonzalez.\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\"I assume you or the other young guy was this \'azrael_lv5\' on the net?\" Brandon queried as they turned into a dark alley. The old man kept silent. Both men walked towards a padlocked door, water stained and moss-encrusted. Ferdinand brought an old key out of his vest pocket, and Brandon immediately recognized it for what it was. \"Wait... that is The...\" Brandon gasped.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\"Silence!\" The old man interrupted him. \"Before you step through this door, remember that I warned you. There is nothing but damnation beyond this door.\" Brandon nodded and entered. As the door closed behind Brandon, the old man sighed. \"Why must the young be so foolish?\" He said as he disappeared into the shadows.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Brandon was in a dark room. The only source of light was a small candle on the palm of a floating disembodied hand. The light flickered as the hand twitched, again and again. Breathing in hard and mustering his strength, he recalled the instructions posted on the nether regions of the Internet and asked the question.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\"What must I protect?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Whispers came from the direction of the disembodied hand. They pierced Brandon\'s mind and he felt as if they were probing him. They were judging him. They were the souls of the Seekers that have failed. If they judged him impure or corrupt, they would rip him apart and take his soul. As each whisper drew near, he saw fleeting images of their lives. Their accomplishments, their victories, and their ends. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Brandon knew what he had to do. He mustered up the courage and steeled his convictions. \"They must never be joined. At least one must be kept away.\" He kept repeating to himself. Light suddenly erupted inside the room. A florescent bulb had switched on. It looked like a warehouse of some sort, with crates stacked up to the ceiling. In the far corner was a young girl. Her long brown hair was scattered around her face and shoulders as she shivered, clutching her legs. Brandon rushed beside her and carried her.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>A whisper echoed in Brandon\'s mind. \"Brandon.\" The voice called him, it was the voice of his father, a Seeker who failed. \"She must never become one with the Others. Protect her. Run. For wherever you go, They will follow. Keep running. As long as she is with you, your mind will be strong, but They will come for her. You will have to run.\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Crashing through the crates and running out the door, Brandon exited the alley into the light of the city\'s neon signs, still cradling the little girl in his arms. A low and steady moan came forth from the direction of the mental institution, 4 blocks away. It sent chills down his spine and affirmed his senses. They were coming for her, as she is The Blank Canvas.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>She is Object 188 of 538. She will play a significant role in the dark days to come, but for now, she must be protected. <br><br>'),
(189, 'Holder of Justice', '<p></p>In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Justice.\" Should an appraising look appear on her face, she will hand you a small gardening spade and a dog\'s leash. You will be led to the institution\'s basement where the attendant will gesture to a trapdoor in a dark corner.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Enter the trapdoor and climb the ancient wooden ladder down into the sub-basement. Once your feet touch the earth below, the trapdoor will slam shut and seal itself. You will emerge in a small earthen room dimly illuminated by a small candle on the far wall. Do not touch this candle, lest it go out; it is all that is preventing this room from being plunged into pitch blackness... and this room\'s fell inhabitant can only sleep with the light on.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>On the wall opposite the candle, you will see an old window frame cut into the soil. Approach the window. If you see your reflection, you are safe to open the window and climb through. If you see no reflection, dive through the window as quickly as possible, for the creature who calls this room home has stirred and is ready to turn the light off and start its day. It is hungry, and your soul is on the breakfast menu.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once through the window, you will find yourself in a gargantuan subterranean cavern with small leafy plants growing in clusters as far as the eye can see, lit by a series of large braziers sticking out of the ground. Unless you have a serious masochistic streak, avoid looking up at all costs, for above hang the rotting and skeletal corpses of countless thousands of babies, their umbilical cords used as nooses. You will see gaunt, haggard looking men in the distance, stooped at the waist, tending to these plants. Should one collapse in the middle of the field, don\'t bother rushing to his aid, for it is already too late. Besides, he will be back, as none can die here - not permanently, anyway. Any who meet their fate in this place become the property of the Holder, their souls forever consigned to tending this macabre garden. Keep moving: the farther you are from these haunted souls and their eternal work, the safer you will be.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will feel a nudge at your shin. At your feet will be a small wire-haired terrier, wagging his tail happily and panting at you. He is to be your companion on this most unfortunate of quests.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Should you hear the beginnings of a tiny scream, quickly clamp your hands over your ears. If you survive, then know that you were quick enough... At least, you were <i>this</i> time. You would be wise to rip part of your shirtsleeve off and roll them into balls to stuff in your ears in hopes that they will be enough to keep the screams at bay, for your task is to find and harvest one specific mandrake root in this field, and all of the legends about them are, unfortunately, true. Put as much distance between yourself and the nearest harvester as possible, for to hear the screams of a mandrake means instant death.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The root you are looking for will not scream when you dig it up, so you will be safe from death on that front. Unfortunately, though, there are countless thousands of plants in this field and you only have one dog to sacrifice and one life to freely live. I would get started if I were you, as the clock is ticking; the Holder is not the only inhabitant of this cavern, but he IS the only one safe from his housemate. Every hour, on the hour, a huge beast comes forth to feed on the harvesters in the field. If you are unlucky enough to observe its entrance, you\'ll notice that the other hunters ignore his presence despite the fact that they are being slaughtered en masse. They have already died at least once and know that they will be back. I would advise you to put as much upwind distance between yourself and this beast as possible when you find your hiding place, for it has an excellent sense of smell and loves fresh meat.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Should, by some miracle, you find the correct mandrake plant without dying, pulling it up will reveal a hole in the ground with a ladder that extends some fifty feet below into a smaller cavern, lit by two lanterns. In the center of the cavern will be a small wooden table with two chairs. On one chair sits an elderly man with a wisp of white hair atop his head, bedecked in opulent robes.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Do not sit in the other chair, no matter how tired you are from your task, for if you do, the man will leap across the table with superhuman speed and rip out your throat.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The man will notice your presence and look up at you with a scowl; he does not appreciate being interrupted, and will not tolerate your presence for long.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must quickly ask the man one - and only one - question: \"What did they do wrong?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The man\'s eyes will sparkle with sudden understanding and he will proceed to explain the history behind the infant corpses in his garden above. You see, mandrake roots will only grow underneath the area where an unrepentant murderer was hanged. Millennia ago, the man started his garden by hanging the perpetrators of unsolved homicides in his garden, but through trial and error found that younger victims created sweeter mandrake roots. Currently hanging in the cavern above are all the babies throughout history who were born from complicated pregnancies which caused the death of the mother.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Many a man is outraged to the point of tears by this man\'s tale. Showing sadness is considered weak and, as a result, the man will rush forward and snap your neck at the slightest hint of grief. What you must do is rush forward and grab the opposite chair, heft it into the air and swing it with all your might, breaking it across the top of the man\'s head. He will crumple to the ground, incapacitated and nearly dead.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Now, you must carry his corpse-like body up the ladder and into the cavern above. The harvesters will stop their work and watch you with hope in their eyes. Do not disappoint them. You will notice a noose already prepared for the man. Slip his neck through it, tighten it, and release. A cheer will go up among the collected workers as the man\'s neck snaps. His death will free the souls of the harvesters and babies, and before long you will find yourself alone in the cavern with the hanging Holder. The ground around you will be clear, the plants having shriveled and disintegrated. Below the man\'s corpse will be a single mandrake plant, glowing an ethereal blue. Dig it up without fear - it owes you. Once extracted, the root will begin to sing a beautiful, haunting melody and you will feel yourself at peace. Set the root down and meditate for roughly five minutes. When you open your eyes, you will find yourself at the kitchen table of the place you call home. The mandrake will be sleeping soundly. Listening to its song now will provide rest and cure all but the most serious wounds.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The mandrake root is Object 189 of 538. It will wail in agony when they all come together.

(190, 'Holder of Putridity', '<p></p>In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit something that calls itself the \"Holder of Putridity\". The attendant will pay no mind to your request and will go about his (and only his) business. Upon the end of that worker\'s shift, follow him home and sleep outside his door. When he returns to work the next day, request an audience with the Holder once more, and repeat the actions from the previous day. After 120 days of requests, the attendant will then gaze at you and gently beckon you to follow.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will lead you out the back door of the institution\'s lobby and into the courtyard of the facility. In the center of this courtyard will be a small well. He will motion for you to leap inside it. Do so, and do not climb out until night is firmly set. To do otherwise will cause your internal organs to revolt and burst inside your body, dooming you to a slow, agonizing death from sepsis. If you do manage to wait in the filth at the bottom of the well for night to come, you can then make your attempt to climb out. If you hear any noise while climbing, climb faster, for if you fail or delay even the slightest amount, the carnal essence of grime and disgust will reach out for you and snap you back into its realm of decay to rot for festering eternities.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Should you make it out of the well, you will see that the landscape of the courtyard has changed. What once was a neatly maintained garden is now a repugnant swamp. As you step out of the corroded stone surface of the well, you\'ll plunge thigh-deep into sickly black waters, periodically bubbling and bursting with an abominable stench of infinite sickness. A glance around will show that you are encased by an impossibly dense ring of coniferous trees, restricting you to this small circle of horrific filth and disgust. Gaze across from where you emerged from the well, however, and you will see Him: a great, hideous pig, gloriously corpulent, gazing at you with listless yet nonetheless malevolent black eyes, his tightly-stretched skin smeared with all colors and textures of blood, semen, and vomit which leak profusely and endlessly from his array of orifices and grotesque sores.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Step up to the porcine abomination and gaze not too long at the perpetually running fluids that emit from his girth, or they may run together to form a picture of diseases and plagues unimaginable to a mere mortal such as yourself. Instead, gaze directly into his beady, pitch-black eyes, and ask a single question: \"How will they infect this world?\" The pig will begin to speak in a grating, squealing, gore-drenched voice, its throat clogged with all breeds of mucus and scum.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>It will tell you every detail of every disease that has walked the earth. You will learn the intricacies of the cellular structure of the Ebola virus, the Black Plague, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, and every other great and small infection that has cursed creatures throughout the ages. You will be instructed in the principles of decomposition in humans and other living creatures, including the horrifying death-rituals and funereal rites of entities from worlds far beyond your own. You will not forget a single detail of what you hear, for what you hear is the testament of putridity in all its majestic forms. And you will learn of the greatest of them all, an infection which will sweep across the earth very soon, bringing a fate infinitely worse than death to all the denizens of the world. If you do not go irrevocably and instantaneously insane from hearing its name alone, you may be able to proceed.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Upon the end of the pig\'s litany of plagues, he will ever so slowly heave his girth to face you directly. At that moment, he will inhale lungfuls of putrid air, and breathe them upon you in an exhalation of utter blackness and sickness. You must breathe deeply of these heinous winds, or the creature before you will not hesitate to devour you, as his hunger is vast and insatiable. If you breathe without hesitation, you will feel yourself fall back into the well of the institution from whence you came, and if you have the strength, you may climb out and continue your journey.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>But upon finally coming back to your world, your body will be wracked with sputtering coughs, and your skin will split and crack with all manners of sores, letting pus and grime run freely across you, and your very soul will seem to turn as black as the cunt of a syphilitic whore. This disease you now carry is Object 190 of 538. Should you bring them together, perhaps this plague will leave you - but at what cost? <br><br>'),

Should you manage to hold on to your wits, the tree will begin coughing on you, and a foul-smelling sap will coat your body, but you must not attempt to turn away or cover your face. If you do, the great roots will ensnare your ankles and you will be dragged under the earth as a source of eternal nourishment for the tree. Forever will you feel its roots boring into your flesh, draining you of your vital fluids, yet never shall you be granted the relief of death, for the tree will also fill your veins with a liquid that will make you immortal.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you manage to stand your ground as the tree is coughing, it will recover its breath and will tell you the tale of those who were buried. The story is long and frightening, and you will wish to cover your ears and scream, but do not, lest the tree make you one of its victims. When the history has been told to you, you must turn your gaze upward, toward the eyes of the tree.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will be fearful and wish to flee, for there is naught but madness and death in those terrible pits, but stand your ground until the tree closes its eyes.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you are able to do so, the face will vanish from the trunk, and a branch will fall to the ground at your feet. It will be thin and forked, but as strong as steel. As long as you possess it, you will find that you have the ability to locate buried items.

The floor will crack, then break entirely, as if it was made of glass. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When you hit the ground below, walk straight ahead until you see a small flame. Keep walking forward until you can see what feeds the flame. Bend down and ask the now very burned thing that was once a man, \"What happened to the ones that were destroyed?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The arm of the thing will reach out and grab your neck as the Holder begins to tell you the tales of every Seeker that was destroyed in his quest and of the Objects that were destroyed. When he is finished telling his stories, his arm will burst into flame once more. Ignore it - it won\'t burn you. If it does burn, then don\'t worry, for you will be dead soon, even if you do let go. Quickly, however, as the world begins to burn away, grab the arm and close your eyes. As the world burns, you will feel the part of the arm you grabbed begin to change into another Object. You will wake up wherever you call home. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The matches in the book you now hold burn with a special flame; whatever their fire touches will be repaired if it is broken, and destroyed if it is whole. Be warned, however, that if you attempt to use it on another human, your flesh will burn instead. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The matchbook is Object 194 of 538. Keep it after all the matches are gone, lest His flame turn on you.  <br><br>'),
(195, 'The Holder of Trade', '<p></p>In any city in any country, enter the largest shopping mall you can find â€“ we recommend you take a fast car for a quick getaway afterwards. Bring with you your most prized possession (not another Object â€“ they are not your possessions; they merely let you hold onto them for a while). Find the Customer Service desk and ask politely to speak to the Holder of Trade, while handing over a cash bribe - $1000 or the local equivalent should do. The person at the desk will look around furtively, and then lead you to the door of a nearby office which you didnâ€™t see before speaking to them. They will knock three times and open the door. The person who steps out should be a burly grey-haired man, wearing a blue business suit and smoking a cigar. If you see anyone else in his place, flee for your life, and with great fortune you may escape. He will greet you gruffly and ask what your business is. Do not be fooled, this is merely the guardian of the one you want. Stare him in the eye and tell him â€œI seek an audience with the true Holder.â€ A look of terror will flash briefly over his face, then be replaced with anger as he tells you he is the Holder, how dare you question him? Keep staring him in the eye and repeat â€œI seek an audience with the true Holder.â€\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Finally he will wilt, and turn back into the office, slamming the door behind him. Do not follow him, nor listen to his pleading and whining on the other side of the door. Finally it will open and he will lead the true Holder out by the hand. The Holder always takes the form of a small child, though its exact appearance varies. It will be carrying a green silk drawstring purse in one hand. Pretend you believe it actually is a child. Try not to look in its eyes; you wonâ€™t like what you see in them.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The child will rush up to you and grasp your hand. Its hands are so cold you will fear that yours will freeze solid and snap. Do not flinch. You are safe as long as you do not show any sign that you know there is something odd about it. Greet the child kindly, coo over it. Ruffle its hair if you like. The guardian will follow it out of the office, reassuming his former gruff manner as he tells you to keep a close eye on his child and take good care of it. Ignore the fact that he is now starting to sprout odd appendages; horns, tentacles, extra eyes, and so on. He is currently harmless; itâ€™s the child you need to watch. The child will look up to you â€“ once again we must point out, do not look it in the eye â€“ and say you brought them a gift. Hand over your most treasured possession. It will take it, look up at you, smile benignly and thank you politely, then tear or smash the item to pieces with inhuman strength. Smile. For the love of your soul, do not protest. Smile at the child, and keep smiling as it takes your hand. The guardian will nod at you and re-enter the office, still shifting form as he does. Turn around, back into the main mall.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The mall looks a little different now. The lights are made of human bones and skulls, glowing a sickly phosphorescent green, just enough to see by. The walls drip stinking blood, and the floor feels as if it is breathing under your feet. You will notice that everyone you pass is turning slowly into something horrible, every one different and each more hideous than the last. Do not respond. Smile at them if they look at you, apologise if you bump into them, and generally act as if they are normal humans. Some of them are; the people who were in the mall are still normal humans, seeing no difference in their surroundings, thinking they are going about their normal business, their metamorphosis pure illusion. Others, however, actually are monsters, losing the illusions which made them seem human. There is no way to tell which is which, and you must not waste your energy trying. Find a shopping cart, there should be one nearby. Do not be put off by the fact that it is made of rotting bones. The child will hand over a scroll of human skin. Take the childâ€™s hand in your left hand, and enter the stores one by one.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Follow the list the child gave you. Parts of it are written in incomprehensible hieroglyphs, but then so are all the labels on the boxes and packages. Match them up closely. Other parts of the list are in your own mother tongue, but they tell only complex riddles to describe which item to take. Be careful; one hieroglyph looks much like another, but if you take the wrong box even once, you will be devoured by what comes out of it. Examine every shelf in every store, make sure you get everything. Donâ€™t worry too much about how long you take. You have all the time in the world, though we advise that you work fast enough that you will still be in condition to drive when you get out.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you work, the child will jabber nonsensical words continually in an increasingly shrill voice and run back and forth, jerking your arm until your shoulder feels close to dislocation. Every time you stop, it will dart forward and scatter items from the cart on the floor. Pick them up with your right hand â€“ <i>do not</i> release the childâ€™s hand for even a moment, pay no heed to the agonising cold of its hands or its wild struggles. Do not show any anger. Smile indulgently at the childâ€™s antics. If you express any emotion other than adoration towards it, it will scream for its brothers and sisters, which are the real monsters among the mutating shoppers, and if you are familiar with the other Holders you should by now have a pretty fair idea of what they will do to you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Scour each shop for every item on the list â€“ you can only enter each store once, so make sure you have read the full list and checked every item in the store. Check off the items on the list as you go, if you can do so one-handed. When you have finished with each one, approach the checkout clerk at the front. The clerks are even more monstrous than the shoppers, and you may feel your mind bending in a futile attempt to comprehend them. Remain resolute. They will glance at your items and tell you a price, and then the child will hold out the silk purse in the hand you are not holding. Place your right hand in the purse without releasing the childâ€™s other hand or taking the purse from it, and dig around for the correct change by feel only. This is even harder than it sounds, even though the currency is of the usual mint of the country you are in; every coin but one in the purse has had its edges chipped and sharpened to razor-fineness. Ignore the mess they will inevitably make of your fingers, do not allow your smile to fade. Do not remove any money other than the correct change from the purse, and certainly do not remove the normal-feeling one, or the coins will all fly out at you sharp-edge-first, eventually leaving your body in pieces. Should this happen, your flesh will be devoured by the demons, each piece still conscious for every second of digestion, and the discs left of your bones will become more coins for the next Seeker to handle. Hand the money to the clerk when you find it, making sure each coin is well smeared with your blood, and say â€œSo shall I shed more blood before this is done, and do it with a will to reach my goal.â€ As you do this, each clerk will nod and fade into nothingness, smiling, insofar as you can tell with their mutilated faces.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>When you have found the last item on the unbearably long list, the writing will fade from the scroll. If you exit the last store having missed even one item, the list will burn to ashes, taking the building and every real human still there with it, and leaving you to suffer perpetually in the pain of the fire and your own rage at yourself for your failure. If you succeeded, head for the front doors. As you come within sight of the outside world, you will be confronted by the most horrible creature yet. If you can bear to look at it without screaming, which would alert the rest of the beasts and call them to feed on you, you may notice that rags of a blue suit hang from its misshapen form. This is the true appearance of the Holderâ€™s guardian, its transformation complete. The Holder will release your hand at this point, run forward and hug the monster. Let it do so, and make sure that you <i>do not lose your smile</i>. Push the cart forward for the beastâ€™s inspection. It will nod, and say â€œDo you have the change?â€\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Politely ask the child to hand you the silk purse. It will do so. Dig around in the purse, laughing and talking as you do so â€“ we recommend you comment on the fabulous deals you found at the stores. Scoop all the coins except for the one with no sharp edges into your hand, but donâ€™t remove your hand from the purse yet. Mutter about how the last few pennies seem to be caught in the lining. Keep making rummaging motions with your hand in the purse and talking absentmindedly until the thing clears its throat impatiently.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Hurl the money into its face and scream as loud as you can â€œIs this a fair trade to keep them at bay?â€ Run towards the doors before it recovers; make sure you still have hold of the purse. The child will follow you. Push it to the ground and leave it, throw yourself out through the front doors, and get away as fast as possible. You will hear the screams of the child as you go; it has failed in its duty, and its kin are exacting their revenge. Do not be tempted to look back, however heartrending â€“ or satisfying â€“ you may find the sound, or you will see what the â€œchildâ€ really looks like, and none who have seen it have remained sane long enough to describe it.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Drive until the next sunrise â€“ do not stop, whatever you may see outside the car, and keep your doors and windows locked. As soon as it is fully light, pull over. Open the purse. In it there will be one final coin left over. Take it, hide it, and burn the purse to ashes. Get some first aid for your hands, and then get some sleep. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The Coin looks like any other coin of the country you are in (a dollar, a pound, a Euro) but the markings on it are of an unknown civilization, and the face it bears is that of an elven creature. When placed under the tongue it gives the gift of languages. The Coin is said to also grant the gift of understanding the languages of animals as well as humans. The Coin is even able to translate written languages, including ciphers. The language of the Objects themselves is immune to the Coin.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The Coin is Object 195 of 538. Be prepared to pay the price for your prize.\r\n<br>');

When you reach the front desk, ask to visit the prisoner who calls himself the \"Holder of Penance\". The workers face will appear calm, but they will press a silent alarm under the desk. Several of the guards will come and seize you, claiming you have been accused of crimes spanning from jaywalking to murder. Do not protest these accusations, any argument or complaint will be answered with brutality.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will be thrown into a cell in the deepest parts of the building and abandoned there. You will not be in there for long, but it will seem like ages. After an unmeasurable amount of time, a guard will unlock your door and tell you it\'s time for your trial. the guard will command you to follow him, and you would do well to obey. The path will twist and turn but you must never lose sight of the guard. If you become lost the cells of the jails will be opened. The prisoners will inflict all kinds of horror upon you, but no matter how much you are hurt you will be healed fully the next day, only to repeat the process over again.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you manage to keep up you will be bought into a small room. The guard will instruct you to remove your clothes. Refusing will cause you to be judged guilty on the spot, and you will receive a punishment that only the damned souls in hell envy. Once you are prepared, the judge will place a crisscrossing chain on your torso. They will be freezing cold, but you must show no sign of weakness. If you shiver, you shall remain frozen in time, but fully conscious, until the very Earth burns out.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will be lead to the front of the courtroom and presented to the judge. His demonic visage will terrify you, but it is highly advised that you keep your eyes on him. Looking away could be conceived as a sign of lying. He will inspect you, and he will only respond to the question \"What did He do wrong?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The judge will cease his inspection and begin to state the charges against you. He will list every wrong doing you have ever committed in your life. He will speak of the most minor crimes, the people you have fought with, and what you have done in your pursuit of the Objects. You must remain silent while he speaks, for even now you are being judged.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The judge will finish his diatribe, and ask you for a closing argument. The only thing you can say that will defend yourself is \"I regret every wrong I have done\". You must mean this. No matter what the reason was, no matter if the action was justified, you must feel truly sorry for it. If you have already met <a href=\"?Holder_of_the_Downtrodden\" class=\"yespage\">The Holder of the Downtrodden</a> or possess <a href=\"?Holder_of_Apathy\" class=\"nopage\">The Mug of Apathy</a> all hope is lost.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The judge will then make his decision. If he finds you guilty, then you will join the audience of people that were present for your trial, forever hearing the misdeeds of others and feeling the pain that resulted from them. However, If the judge deems you innocent, he will step down from the podium, shake your hand, unlock your chains, and tell you exactly what went wrong with the Objects and this world. His explanation seems to be simple, yet is so complex that many stay in this courtroom for ages contemplating it. You must not do this, for this is exactly what the judge wants. The Judge is in fact the Holder, and if you still remain in the court when the chains are needed again, he will break every one of your bones with his gavel and leave you to die. The way out is as easy as grasping the chains that now lie at your feet.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will wake up inside of your own home knowing that, for the moment, you are safe. After all, you\'ve been found innocent, right? The chains have wrapped themselves around your chest again. They are still cold, but you will not be bothered by them. There\'s no taking them off now, so you might as well learn to live with it.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The freezing chains you must wear are Object 196 of 538, a reminder of sins formerly lost to time.

(197, 'The Holder of Laughter', '<p></p>In any city, in any country, walk into a restaurant, it doesn\'t matter which. Walk up to the host/hostess, or if there is none, wait for a staff member to come up to you and ask if you\'ve been helped. When they ask, ask if you could join \"The Holder of Laughter.\" If they giggle and shake their head, you\'ve found the right place. They will escort you to a private room near the back of the restaurant. They will chuckle as they reach for the door, as if a comedian\'s dialog was playing in their head. When it opens, walk inside. There will be a single spotlight shining on what appears to be a stage and a microphone. Walk up to the microphone and turn to face the front of the stage. Lights, what will probably seem like stage lights, will hide the audience from your view, all of which are sitting at scattered tables. Which is good, because the audience is filled with beings so foul, it\'s best not to even begin to describe them. Give them each a wide smile as you stand there. If you don\'t have stage fright, tell the first joke that comes to mind. Any joke. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the audience doesn\'t laugh, immediately head off the same way you came on. If you\'re lucky, the door will be open, and you can go back into the restaurant, and maybe have a nice meal and ignore what just happened for the time being. If, however, they do laugh, smile again and tell another joke. No matter what, they will laugh at this joke as well. Tell a third. If the laughter grows louder, take three bows. One to the left side of the audience, one to the right, and one to the center. After the third bow, the stage lights will go down, but the spotlight will stay on you. Look up and keep the smile on your face as you look past the beings in the audience, which have started to dissipate by now. If you let your smile droop, they will see, and strike you down with words and insults so harsh, they would drive even the happiest, most cheerful person to ritualistic suicide. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You\'ll see another light focusing on table near the back. Sitting at the table is another man, whose wide, almost menacing grin puts yours to shame. Jump off the stage and land on one of tables. Do not land on the floor. If you do, you will just keep falling and falling into a never-ending void, where you will never feel the joy of laughter again. Jump from table to table, until you get back to the man. He will be wearing a backwards baseball cap and a sports jersey. However, the text on both of these is ancient and unintelligible, yet you can tell they say something comedic. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The man will start to tell you a few of his jokes. Laugh at each of them sincerely. Show him that you still have a bit of humanity in you.... The bit of you that enjoys laughing. Laugh honestly and heartily. If you fake it, he can tell. And he will not be pleased. After he is through, he will ask \"So, what brings you to this side of town?\" Smile calmly and happily and start to ask him \"What will the Objects...\" before he holds up a hand to halt your question. His smile will remain there as he holds up a noisemaker. Take it from him. He\'ll answer back \"I don\'t have the answers you seek.\" His voice will echo and billow, as if he could break out in a fit of chuckles at any moment. This Holder always was a happy one. He looks up at you and gives a wink. Before sending you on your journey, he adds \"Beware the Clumsy Man. He does not know of your quest, nor does he wish any ill harm, but if he finds any Object, he will ruin any plans you have for them.\" With this, he gives one last nod, before fading into blackness. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Suddenly, a path will appear out of mid air. It appears to be made of clear nothingness, but further inspection will show you that it is actually glass. Follow the path back to the stage, but never look down through it. If you do, you will fall into eternity. Instead, hurry to the stage and out of the door. The Doorman will say one thing to you before shutting the door, don\'t try to open it, as it will lead nowhere.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The Doorman\'s Joke is object 197 of the 538.

(198, 'Holder of Blazes', '<p></p>In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or hospital you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, make sure the person there is a woman. Hand her any book, so long as the words â€œI wishâ€ are written on the cover in your own blood; otherwise you will be turned away. The woman will look through the book with an expression of ecstasy on her face and give it back. You must not open this book or the images it now holds would destroy your mind. The woman will lead you to the room of a young child with a strip of black cloth tied around his head. You must speak to him in a mocking tone, or he will remove the cloth. You must ask him the question, â€œWhy will it happen?â€œ Only then will the child accompany you to your destination. The woman will remove her finger with a scalpel and hand it to the boy, then collapse onto the ground. Though the sounds of her agony will torment you, you must look away.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This boy will lead you to an unused wing of the hospital. Strange beings inhabit this place, and you will see some of them shuffling down the hallways. Do not look any of them in the eye; inviting as they may seem, most will tear you apart in seconds. After several hours, you will arrive at an old, decrepit door. The boy will insert the womanâ€™s finger into the keyhole, and it will open. This will be your final chance to leave unscathed. If you choose to leave, you must burn the book and throw yourself into the fire, for it will be a much more pleasant death then what the book has in store. If you choose to continue, you must step through the doorway and pull the child along behind you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will walk down many flights of stairs; trying to count them all would drive you insane. You will see the shadows of beasts suspended in the air by chains, and any attempt to return up the stairs would be halted by them. If you hear any noise besides your footsteps, sit down right away and yell, â€œI will continue my journey. You have no right to stop me.â€ If the sound continues, hold the boy over your head. This is for his benefit, as the suffering that the darkness brings is preferable to being alone.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>When you reach the bottom of the stairs, close your eyes and concentrate until you can picture a door in front of you. If you succeed, the door will appear as it did in your mind. Hold the book towards the door and open it. A creature from the illustrations of a madman will unlock to door for you, then join the creatures hanging in this room.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Open the door; beyond lies a finely furnished ballroom. Do not enter until a well-dressed man invites you in. He will offer to take your coat, but you must politely decline. You must ask him one question: â€œWho will end it?â€ The man will offer you a bemused glare and tell you of the world\'s deepest, darkest secrets. He will describe, in horrifying detail, all the sins committed by man. His explanation is enough to drive even the most stalwart of minds insane. This is the only time you may look at the contents of the book, open it to any page and read it; the text will be in an evil, unnatural language, but your mouth will reshape itself to pronounce the terrible words. When you have read four pages top to bottom, the man will fall silent. If you go mad before then, you can at least take some comfort in knowing that the pain you\'ll soon suffer will be considerably more bearable. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The man will lunge at you, his true form no longer hidden. His claws will tear through space itself. Beautiful women will tempt your vision, but you must concentrate on fighting. This is a battle for your life. If he wins, your very existence will be naught but eternal, undying pain. Once the man changes his form again, open the book once more. The beings inside will grab the man and the boy, pulling them into the book and muffling their screams with death.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will fall to the floor in terror now, and when you awake, you will find yourself in the boyâ€™s room, wearing his strip of cloth. Though it burns, do not remove it until you have left the building, for the sight of what now occupies the institution will be far too much for your fragile body to handle, and they will be alerted to your presence. Once you have left, carefully remove the cloth from your head and wrap it around the book.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This book is Object 198 of 538. It is your only means of protection against Him when they are brought together.  <br><br>'),

When you get to the entrance, ask the person behind the ticket counter to see the \"Holder of Thrill.\" The person will look at you with great respect, and let you through into the park. As soon as you enter, run and find the roller coaster. If there isn\'t one, then you\'re a fool. You entered without thinking, and everything around you will go black as you slowly descend into hell.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you manage to reach it, get in and ignore the ride operator who will surely question your actions. Tell him what you came for, and he\'ll start the ride, and you will be thrown at what seems like impossible speeds. As long as you hang on to anything tightly, you\'ll be safe. As you go on, everything around you will mix and transform, and it will seem like you\'ve traveled into another reality. The things you will see may drive you mad, aliens and creatures will appear around you. You can scream, you can cry, anything you want an long as you hang on tight to the cart you\'re riding in. Finally, a blue and black monster with twenty eyes will approach you. Now is the time to be silent. It will appear to be floating as you continue to ride the hellish machine you\'re on. It will blink, with every eye. It may seem scary, but as you continue to gaze at it, you\'ll begin to feel sympathetic toward it. Your instincts will tell you not to insult it. Simply stare.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Ask it, \"Does He long for thrill?\" Suddenly, your mind will be blasted with thousands of messages, they will make you hear voices, and maybe even make you go insane.

You have been gone thousands of years, the amusement park is gone, everything is destroyed, there seems to be no civilization anywhere, and the sky is covered with dust. Careful where you step; there are likely mines surrounding you. Take three steps to the left. You will suddenly feel as though the ride you just got off of was the ride of your life, and you will likely try to get in the roller coaster car you were in and try to go again. But as you turn to board the ride anew, you will see a letter. It will have a picture of you, as people considered you missing. It also says you could\'ve stopped a war that was coming. Don\'t wonder - just think about it.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will feel as though you were to blame for everything, for the end of the human race as you know it. Take the letter, and you will be back in your own time.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The letter is Object 199 out of 538. You had your thrill, and you long for it again. But it comes at a huge cost.

(200, 'The Holder of Navigation', '<p></p>In any city, in any country, go to any visitor information center you can get yourself to. When you get to the front desk, ask the receptionist where you can find the one who calls himself \"The Holder of Navigation\". They should reach underneath the desk and hand you a thick, leather-bound book. <b>Do not</b> open the book just yet, or you will find that the pages are blank, thus destroying your chances of meeting the Holder. Instead, take the book and, without saying another word, leave the information center.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will immediately notice two things once you pass through the front door. First, it will be exactly midnight, no matter what time you arrived at the information center. Second, your surroundings will be the exact opposite of where you originally came from. If the information center was located in the heart of a major city, you will find yourself in a rural area with rolling hills and deep ravines. Conversely, if the information center was in a sparsely-populated area, you will find yourself in a massive metropolis with tall buildings extending in all directions.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once you have stepped outside, open the book the receptionist gave you. You see, to reach this particular Holder, you must follow a specific route through the streets and alleys of this new world, and the contents of the book will guide you on this path. At first, it will lay the route out in simple directions (\"Turn right at X street, turn left at Y avenue\"), but as you proceed further down the route, the instructions will grow more cryptic, until eventually you will have to solve complex, mind-boggling riddles in order to figure out where to go next. At each choice in your path, make sure you know beyond a shadow of a doubt which direction to take before proceeding. A single wrong choice will cause the Holder\'s location to change, and your book will not update its contents to reflect it. In any event, you\'ll definitely want to make sure you\'re not still outside when sunrise comes; like in your world, the denizens of this world will be ready to start their day. To put it mildly, they don\'t take kindly to outsiders.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you manage to follow the entire route perfectly before sunrise, you will arrive at a sprawling mansion more beautiful than any home you\'ve ever seen. Knock on the door; in a few moments the estate butler will greet you. He will lead you into the mansion and guide you through its twisting halls and corridors. You must follow him to a point, but you <i>don\'t</i> want to follow him the whole way, for he seeks only to lead you to your demise. If you break from him too early, however, you will become hopelessly lost inside this sprawling labyrinth. The Holder and his butler are not the only two inhabitants of this mansion, but they are by far the least harmful to you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You see, as the butler guides you through the estate, you will see clues in your surroundings that tell you where you need to go. For a while they\'ll match up with the butler\'s route, but eventually you will notice one that tells you to go a different way. Once you break away from the butler, continue to follow your surroundings\' advice until you reach a steel door. There\'s no need to knock on this one; just head in.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The door will open to a massive room filled from wall to wall with video monitors. Each monitor displays a stunningly accurate map of a certain place in the universe.

He will respond to nothing save a single question. Your question will depend on whether you Seek for their Reunion, Separation, or Destruction. For example, if you seek for Reunion, you must ask the captain, \"What is the path to Reunion?\" and similarly for Separation and Destruction.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The captain will not move, but he will lay out, in painstaking detail, exactly what must be done to lead you to the end that you seek. If you have any desire at all to fulfill this end, from here on out you must follow exactly what the captain has told you. Of course, this path only takes the present into account; if anything on that path should change (and with how long the path is, it <i>will</i>), you must be ready to adapt at a moment\'s notice.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once the captain has finished explaining the path you must take, the video monitors on the wall will grow brighter until their light becomes blinding.

They will invite you to join them, but you must politely decline. If you accept they will attack, killing you in the slowest manner possible.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Your task is to find the Holder, and it will not be a difficult one. He will be wearing long black robes and his head will be covered in a hood. If you approach him and tap on his shoulder, you will get his attention. You must ask, in a calm and polite voice, \"Who are the victims?\" Saying anything else will cause him to remove his hood. If you are driven insane by the sight, consider yourself lucky, for it may give you some small relief from the eternity of torture facing you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you have done everything correctly, the Holder will begin to speak. His voice will be low and soft, but it will fill your soul with intense coldness. He will tell you of every person that has died and will die because of the Objects. He will tell you of their lives, their loved ones, and the impact their death had on the world. The calm scene around you will fade as he tells his story. The students will grow older until they die and their bodies rot, and the fountain will start flowing blood.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will feel personally responsible for everything the Holder tells you, but you must remain impassive through all of this. This seems to be a demanding task, but after all you have been through, it may be quite easy. If you listen to the Holder without so much as a twitch, he will ask you what you intend to do with this knowledge. Smile at the Holder, and ask him, \"Why ask what you already know?\" The Holder will nod somberly and hand you his ID card. He will crumple into dust, and the dead bodies around you will awaken. They will be quite mad at you, as the Holder was the only thing keeping them at peace. The only way to escape this is to put on the robe the Holder was wearing.

He will drone on for what may seem like centuries about the wars, the hate, that humanity has forgotten about. When he finishes, turn to his companion and ask, â€œWhat were their loves?â€ He will then tell you Their every passion, love, and cherished moment. He will tell you art beyond comprehension, of honor beyond reproach, of beauty beyond compare.

As you are descending the steps, a feeling of uncertainty will wash over you. No matter how you try, the feeling will remain in the back of your mind, growing stronger with every step. The principal will lead you to the farthest corner of the basement. The closer you get to the corner, the more light is sapped out of your surroundings. With the light goes all feeling of hope.

The effect of every wrong ever done and the cost of bringing about good. He will tell you what will happen if you fail to complete this trial in horrendous detail. The pain and suffering that enters your mind will make you wish you had given into the beasts before.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You can not show or feel any emotion. If you show sadness, hate, anger, fear, or any other negative emotion you will be corrupted and joined to the holder.

If you show compassion, longing, joy, or humor you will have your memories swapped with that of a soul unable to conceive such thoughts.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you are righteous,steadfast in your resolve, and manage to keep your wits through this hellish ordeal the creature will disappear, and you will be left in a room of white. You will hear an angelic choir, and the only thing in this heavenly room will be a white garment and holy water. These items contain the power to banish all evil ever experienced by one person. One time. Put the garment on and read the book. Every horrible feeling or evil thing you\'ve ever experienced will be banished from you And the effects left on your mind from this trial will be cured\r\n<br>\r\n<br>After this a door will appear Exit and you will awake at daybreak where you fell asleep knowing that now you carry a blessing From now on every kind act you do for another will be multiplied in its effect But you will also feel the repercussions of any act of selfishness greed or such and how its effect is spread You can now choose to aid Seekers or live the rest of your life how you wish No one would think any less of you for doing so either Just remember that wherever you go you now decide who to bless with your aid and who to leave to the whim of the world\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will now find the garment damp from holy water lying in front of the entrance in whatever place you call home This garment is Object 2000 of 2538 Carry the memory of the cost high on your shoulders\r\n<br>'),

(2548, 'Holder of Language', 'I heard a bunch of stories from an odd old man living on the streets a few years ago some bizarre quest for \"Objects\" that doomed the world or somesuch He\'d never ask for money or food, all he wanted was for his stories to be heard.. One of his stories really popped out to me, though, so I decided to try it. I wish I hadn\'t\r\n<br>\r\n<br>First I had to go to a small library He said it doesn\'t matter where, or if you have membership there. You\'re supposed to ask any elderly librarian for \"The Holder of Language\" If she responds with unearthy words and gestures you to some dark corner of the library you continue but if she tells you that it is on hold you\'ve gotta quickly find any book in the library on language and read it completely within the hour. The old man never said what would happen if you didn\'t but I was stuck with the latter anyway Just as I finished the book the library began to close so I decided to try again another day\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This time it worked The old woman wailed with some earpiercing singing sound that no one else seemed to notice and pointed me toward an old unused corner of the library I took a random book and sat in that corner pretending to read it as I was supposed to do\r\n<br>\r\n<br>It seemed like hours before it happened and it came so suddenly that I almost pissed myself The walls closed in the floor opened up and I began falling No sensation of falling just Movement After about five seconds I found myself in what appeared to be an ancient archive and by ancient I mean like <b>ancient</b> The shelves were made of rough hewn stone and were filled with tablets and scrolls with words from every language randomly interspersed between them I made the mistake of trying to read them but I\'ll spare you from those details... I just barely managed to escape after that, and had to come back the next day. I don\'t know what possessed me to continue but I am still hella freaked out by those <i>things</i>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>It wasn\'t too long after I returned to the archive that a young man dressed in ancient scholarly attire greeted me from across a corridor, gesturing that I come follow him. He lead me to some sort of study hall with all sorts of statues and such (the old man said not to look into the statues\' open mouths Again he did not say why and sat down I asked him to use yes use The Holder of Language in as stern a tone as I could make He of course didn\'t understand my words, but the tone seemed to have roused him. He got up and lead me into an old tunnel system spanning the underside of the archive, and what I experienced in there was just.. Let\'s just say I don\'t want to think about it. You\'re on your own here but whatever you do don\'t open your mouth. The old man said having \"<a href=\"?Holder_of_Silence\" class=\"yespage\">Object 31</a>\" was almost invaluable, as was \"<a href=\"?The_Holder_of_Sound\" class=\"yespage\">The Ear</a>\", but I (think) I made it through all in one piece without them.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>I eventually reached a more modern looking room with several small children chained to the walls. If you can bring yourself to do it, you\'re supposed to take your chisel and remove each of their jaw bones discarding the teeth If you can\'t do it, the old man said the path back through the way you came will lead you back to the small library, but that which you passed earlier won\'t be happy to see you again\r\n<br>\r\n<br>There will be a small forge in the back of the room I picked up the hammer and it was like my hands had a life of their own I formed the bone into a small square tablet and detailled its edges with a strange knotlike pattern that seemed to defy its two dimensional space The old man said not to stare at it while you\'re making it no matter how curious you may be, and to let your hands do all of the work, or you will replace the chisel for the creation of the next tablet; it is the Holder.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>I then wrote what felt like words on it, with my hands guiding my every step, even though I began to feel control coming back, let the process go on. If you influence its face in any way aside from what your hands are doing now, you\'ll forget every language you ever knew and be unable to learn or relearn any other The old man didn\'t tell me that; the jaw-less children chanted it silently in a language that I could not fathom, yet understood regardless.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>When I finished, I finally got to look at it. On it was detailled the most beautiful carvings I\'ve ever seen with flowing letters forming words of unearthly perfection When I looked up I found myself back at the library sitting in the corner with the tablet in place of the book\r\n<br> \r\n<br>The bone tablet I carved is <b>Object 941 of 2538</b> If you obtain it deciphering its text will give you insight into every language ever devised but be warned  I know now that there are some languages mankind was never meant to understand Also the library will still want their book back\r\n<br>'),

amusing In recognition of your tenacity misguided though it may be I will tell you my story You will learn some of what you came here to find out and youll probably even be sane by the end of it\r\n<br> \r\n<br>	I first learned of the Holders and their functions through of all things a pencil I was exploring the depths of my favorite library in the center of the town where I lived It was a beautiful building tall and extensive made mostly of stone Gargoyles looked down from the slanted roof of the place and two angelic statues guarded the entrance their hands raised in a sign of benediction Inside it was a veritable palace a temple to the collected knowledge of our race Shelves upon shelves and rows upon rows of books spread out like a small city until it met the far wall which seemed like it was miles away I loved that place and whenever I could I would make some excuse to spend hours among the writings of great ancient and sometimes terrible people I could have spent three lifetimes in there and still not read every book it housed within its walls \r\n<br>        \r\n<br>        The library was five stories tall each level storing several sections on a multitude of topics It was rare to come seeking a particular subject and be unable to find anything My personal favorites were those stories which would likely interest you as well stories of things hidden and occult and dark I reveled in the accumulation of forbidden knowledge and even those books which were obviously fiction I devoured with relish I even read the Necronomicon once or twice though I was more careful with that one than most and I took care to never read aloud I was a collector you see and had no intention of putting this knowledge to practical use For me simply knowing these things was enough and to this day I wonder if that was what drew the Objects attention\r\n<br>         \r\n<br>        One day on one of my excursions to find a book of a particularly nasty reputation I found myself in the corner of the fifth storey about as far from the entrance as one could get The fifth storey was where many of the oldest tomes were to be found kept in a rarely visited section due to general lack of interest by the populace I was looking through the musty dimly lit shelves when my foot caught upon some unseen crack in the floor I stumbled and out of reflex grabbed the shelf next to me for support Of course books dont usually make very good anchors and all I succeeded in doing was to pull a number of books down on top of me I painfully picked myself up off the floor and began to put the books back on the shelf As I picked up the last book that had fallen I noticed something odd It was a smaller than most of the heavy volumes common in this part of the library about the size of an average hardback novel The cover itself seemed to be made of lowquality leather and was almost completely devoid of decoration There was no title no embossed images nothing whatsoever to identify what was inside the book I was holding My curiosity quickly took hold of me and I opened to the first page \r\n<br>        \r\n<br>        The pages inside were filled with handwritten text in a language that I had never seen before The pages themselves were devoid of any lines to guide the writer yet each sentence was almost perfectly aligned marching along the pages in lockstep with the rest of the writing It appeared to be some sort of journal Intrigued I flipped through the remainder of the book About threequarters of the way through it a pencil fell out from where it had been wedged between the pages bouncing on the floor and coming to rest near my feet The pages after where the pencil had been were blank and it seemed as though the mystery author had stopped midword Bending to pick up the pencil I found it almost more of a mystery than the book \r\n<br>        \r\n<br>        It was not the sort of writing utensil that you would normally see adorning the desk of every student in the country It looked almost like a twig from a tree the surface was covered with what looked like bark and it was very slightly crooked in a few places The leadtipped point was about the only thing that identified it as a tool for writing Moreover as I turned it over in my hands I noticed that it was covered in writing of the same alphabet as the writing in the book I looked closer and as I turned the pencil I saw something that made me drop the thing with a start The text was moving swirling across the instrument as though just beneath the surface I stared at it for several seconds as it lay on the floor trying to decide whether what I had just seen was real or whether I had been up in that section for too long  After a few moments I bent and gingerly picked it up again as though I were handling some sort of poisonous spider I stared at the text intently but this time it remained firmly etched into the bark This was more than enough to convince me to study my discovery more closely and as the journal had no identifying marks I figured it would be alright to borrow it without troubling one of the librarians I left the library quickly with both book and pencil hidden in my jacket\r\n<br>\r\n<br>        I reached my home in the late afternoon and went immediately to my desk in the den I lived alone so I didnt bother to close and lock the door as I normally do when guests are about I kept my assorted collection of oddities in there and their presence had been known to unnerve some of my visitors I opened the journal and set to work looking through my personal library for anything that would match the text in it Hours went by as I searched through thousands of years of languages I even went as far back as the dialects of ancient Babylon though why anyone would write in such dialects in this day and age was unknown to me Finally in a tome on Sanskrit which I had acquired more on a whim than anything else I found a similar arrangement of letters A few more comparisons between books and I was able to read a single word of the journal \r\n<br>\r\n<br>        I didnt know what was so special about this particular word all it said was watch or see depending on the context but as I read it a feeling of something profound and horrible came over me My body began to shake and I remember having the distinct feeling of someone standing in the doorway to the den I turned in horror to stare at the open door but saw nothing The feeling didnt abate and I stood up in a rush to distance myself from that demonic book As I backed away I tripped over the legs of my overturned chair and fell to the floor I blacked out\r\n<br> \r\n<br>        When I came to the feeling was gone though I was still very jumpy I put my hand to my head but felt no wound I must have fainted from fear How very heroic of me I thought to myself as I righted my chair and sat down again I read the word in the journal again just to see if it would affect me the same way Nothing Whatever it was that I had felt before had gone I stayed up late into the night attempting to decode the rest of the text but had no luck The language was obviously a distant relative of Sanskrit but if there was a record of its existence I did not possess it Finally I collapsed onto my couch in the corner of the room and slept \r\n<br>\r\n<br>        I woke in the morning after a few hours of surprisingly restful sleep and immediately sat down at my desk I flipped through the journal one last time and regretfully closed it For the time being it was a lost cause Instead I picked up the pencil The text carved into it remained stubbornly fixed Why I did what I did next is unknown even to me all these years later I opened the journal to a blank page set the pencil to it and began to write My intention was to write a simple sentence something glib and asinine like I have an evil pencil but what was on the page when I finished was not what I had meant to write It was in my native tongue but what it said renewed the sharp pang of fear that I had felt before No I will not tell you what it said because that is not for you to know I was a fool to meddle in these things and at the very least I can attempt to prevent you from the same folly Overcoming my hesitation I tried again firmly fixing the sentence I wanted to write in my mind The result was the same a different sentence from the first one and vastly different from what I had intended I should have stopped right there I should have burned the book and the hideous stylus and never pursued such things again Instead in the grip of my misguided curiosity I kept writing\r\n<br>        \r\n<br>        I allowed myself to fall under the power of whatever resided in that artifact writing page after page of grotesqueries that I would never have dared to think about under normal circumstances As I wrote I read my work absorbing the knowledge it held I learned of the Holders and the Seekers and the 2538 Objects that will bring about the End I learned of all of these things and more and it seemed as though my mind was cast with incredible force to the furthest reaches of existence and back again At some point I realized why the original author had stopped writing he or she couldnt bear the horror of what they wrote I dont know how many hours or days passed while I sat at my desk writing but after a while I came to the slow realization that my arm wasnt moving anymore I looked down at the page and saw that I had filled the rest of the journal It lay open on the last page the contents staring balefully up at me The last page wasnt just words per se but more of a picture \r\n<br>\r\n<br>        A perfect circle sat in the center surrounded by text The words bent and twisted forming circles themselves around the central one Some of these circles of text were concentric others merely intersected but all of them drew the eye to the one in the center and all of them were in that same language that dominated the journal when I had found it Slowly and with a growing sense of unease I began to trace the circles with my finger coming evernearer to the large central circle I didnt know why I was doing it the language was just as much a mystery to me then as when I had found the journal but it seemed the correct thing to do Finally I touched the center of the page\r\n<br>\r\n<br>        My senses all betrayed me and it was as though each of them individually had decided to interpret reality the way they wanted rather than working together I heard things that had no bearing on what I saw or what I felt or what I smelled and nothing I experienced seemed to connect properly to the others It was chaos perfect and complete I panicked unable to make any sense of what I was experiencing It was like trying to carry on twelve different conversations that all began at once I spiraled into a cacophony of madness \r\n<br>\r\n<br>       When I finally could make sense of my surroundings again I was amazed to find myself in a library This was not the library where I loved to spend my time No this one was far older Most of the books were no more than piles of mold and even the shelves seemed somehow petrified from age Also unlike the library that I frequented this one was entirely contained in one room There were no other floors just one cyclopean room stretching back into the darkness Despite the complete lack of light I found that I could somehow see and I discerned some sort of door at the far end of the expanse Having no other obvious exit I headed towards it As I drew closer the door became clearer becoming a massive ironbound portal into a room beyond \r\n<br>        \r\n<br>        Through the door was a long hallway flanked on either side by statues in various stages of disrepair There were no doors on either side and like the previous room it was completely dark No two statues were exactly the same and though at first they seemed similar to ancient Greek or Roman sculptures they rapidly became monstrous and strange the further down the hall I walked I told myself it was just a dream but I flinched nonetheless when I thought I saw several of them move I realized that I was moving with purpose that can only be achieved by one who knows exactly where he is going and as I passed certain statues I performed a number of odd signs with my hands I had no idea why I viewed some statues with calm and reverence while I sprinted past others until they were out of sight All of them looked equally odd and horrible to me I knew the various actions I performed held significance and that terrible things would happen if they were not done but how I knew that was a mystery Finally after an eternity of walking I reached the end of the hall  \r\n<br>\r\n<br>        At the end of the hall was a small simplelooking door and here I stopped short That feeling that had so suddenly come upon me in my den washed over me again I felt the most powerful sense of dread that I have ever experienced before or since It was almost physically painful to stand there in front of that door I began to shake uncontrollably and I could barely assert enough influence over my own body to raise a hand towards the doorknob Somewhere in the ruins of my consciousness I knew the better part of me was screaming screaming for me to turn and run as fast as I could until I had left this place behind Without knowing how I knew I was certain that my death lay beyond that door With a supreme effort of will I finally overrode my judgment and grasped the knob After all I had come this far Id be damned if I was going to run when I was so close to knowing to understanding what that terrible book and pencil truly were and why I feared them more than the most hideous demon I opened it\r\n<br>\r\n<br>        On the other side I found myself in a circular room about thirty feet across The walls were entirely covered with books but these were not the rotting tomes that I had found before These were intact though obviously very old and they gave off an aura of great and terrible power In the center of the room sat a man scribbling in a book that sat on the desk in front of him His head was bent towards his work so I could not see his face clearly His clothes were of a fashion I was unfamiliar with long and flowing and every inch of fabric was covered with words and symbols I recognized them as the letters of that forgotten language I had tried to decipher letters that I had written on that final page of the journal He seemed to take no notice of me though he must have heard me come in I stood frozen for a minute in the doorway then steeled myself and took a step forward The man did not move he merely kept scribbling in the book I took a step closer still no response I took another and another and found myself looking down at the mans hunched form He did not react I reached down to touch his shoulder \r\n<br>        \r\n<br>        Before my hand had even brushed his garment he reacted with impossible speed I nearly jumped out of my skin as his bony fingers clamped around my arm He looked up and I stared directly into his eyes The man was me Every line every feature of my face was staring back at me from that wizened body The eyes though the eyes were different They had no pupils but seemed to open past the irises into a space of immeasurable depth In those eyes I saw planets stars and galaxies form and die in the space of seconds I saw the birth and downfall of civilizations and I saw the terrible darkness creeping across our own world corrupting or destroying all I realized I was screaming but my doppelganger did not let go He drew his other hand back and I saw that it was holding that accursed pencil the same one that I had left sitting on my desk an untold distance from where I now stood I barely had enough time to grasp his intent before he plunged the instrument into my chest I stiffened and I felt my heart stop The last memory I have of that place is my double leaning over my body reaching for me His mouth was moving but I could not make out the words before my vision darkened \r\n<br>\r\n<br>        I awoke to find myself standing amid the aisle of my own library in the same spot where I had first discovered the book In my left hand I held the journal and the right the pencil The tip was crusted with blood Horrified I checked myself for wounds but found none I briefly considered putting both of the hideous objects back where I found them but even the thought of letting them go repulsed me Stuffing them into my jacket for the second time I left \r\n<br>\r\n<br>        Since then I have come to know what I truly found in that library I understand now what that dark place was and what I did there I ignored my better judgment reached past the boundaries of sanity for the sake of knowledge I was willing to pursue that knowledge at any cost even that of my soul and so the Holder gave me what I wished for He imparted his knowledge to me He made me the Holder of Records\r\n<br>\r\n<br>        With the knowledge I have gained I have traveled to places no human eyes have ever seen or ever will again I have reached into the darkness of space to touch what would drive you mad to comprehend At all times I feel the presence of the other objects and those who hold and seek them Even the mind of Legion sitting in his dark museum is open to me though he knows it not I am no longer human\r\n<br> \r\n<br>        All of that power of course came with a cost I am forbidden from using my power to help or hinder those who seek the Objects I may only watch and record their stories for eternity I no longer have a say in the fate of the cosmos What happened to the book and pencil I burned the book it was no longer necessary The pencil sits in a case in Legions collection He came to demand it one day and I happily gave it over but it will do him no good It is still an Object but the letters have gone from its surface The erudition it held was for me and me alone\r\n<br> \r\n<br>        What was the point then of coming to me when I cannot help you You didnt expect

I think I used to be human, but when you guard an Object that is so avidly sought and you perform acts so atrocious on the seekers that come for it your humanity fades.

You are the star of the story but far from in control.

I wish I was so lucky to escape however it was not deemed to be so, for what felt like years I lived in his dark mind, struggling through dark dungeons and facing foes insurmountable however my story ended differently to most. He wrote and I obeyed: I struggled to him in his own story before wrenching the key from his grasp.

That keeper was me. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>I am immortal now for as long as I deemed necessary. Though I am trapped guarding this god forsaken pen. Each time I write a story for someone my soul is rendered. It is painful beyond bearing but at least I do not die. The torment of the seeker is my only amusement.

His will was like a solid wall stopping me. I broke down and I wrote horrible things about him yet none of it came to pass. His gaze never stopped drilling into my skull. Eventually, I gave up. I yearned the release death would bring. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>I brought him to me and wrote that he should stab me before taking the pen. Instead, he said that he had no intentions of being the guardian and grabbed the pen from my hand before quickly writing something. I curse him every day because he ended his story himself.
