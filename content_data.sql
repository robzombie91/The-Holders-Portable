At first it will be barely audible, as if originating from a point a great distance away, but as you approach the end of the hallway, the screams will grow clearer and more thunderous, until they drone so loudly as to consume all other noises. The din will quickly become so painful that you will feel the unrelenting urge to claw at your own ears to escape it; resist this impulse. The worker, stoically enduring the cacophony, will show you a door. As swiftly as they can, they will unlock it and run, leaving you alone in this cramped, dark hallway.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This will be your last chance to run. If you decide to continue, open the door; the piercing wail will then end abruptly, leaving your ears ringing. The room you will enter will be coated in an almost tangible darkness that consumes all but the far wall. Manacled to that wall is an emaciated figure covered in raw lashes. He will stare directly at you with a maniacal grin plastered to his face, seemingly undisturbed by his festering wounds and the scalpel rammed into his chest. The only way to save yourself from this man\'s dark designs is to ask \"Who created them\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will cackle in a manner befitting the death throes of an animal before responding His will be the most horrific tale you have ever heard beyond such primitive concepts as pain and death It will delve deep into the very essence of evil those of weak mind would go mad hearing it\r\n<br>\r\n<br>When he finishes it will be up to you to release this man from his terrible burden Remove the scalpel and he will shudder once in agony before falling silent forever\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That scalpel is Object 3 of 538 It is up to you if the rest should be protected or destroyed <br><br>'),

Inside will be a seemingly endless corridor that far exceeds the length of that outhouse.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The corridor will be completely silent. Attempting to make any sound at the wrong time is a grievous, lamentable mistake. You will notice the lights in the corridor getting brighter and brighter as you make your way down towards the end; eventually, you will find yourself blinded by their brilliance. If, at any point the lights go out, quickly shout out, \"No! Stop! What you are doing is wrong!\" while backing away. If the lights do not come back on, bolt for the door you came in through. It should still be open; hopefully you aren\'t far enough down the hallway for it to close on you If it does close an eternity in Hell would be preferable to what you will suffer\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the lights come back on continue walking down the corridor At the end of the hall lies a cell the worker will open its door for you while glaring at you in disgust Inside the cell will be a mad pastiche of colors arranged in several harlequinlike formations You must not be distracted by them for at the center of the room is a naked young woman slathered in blood and bound by strips of human sinew and you would be better off not knowing what will happen if you take your eyes off of her face for even a moment Focus on her and ask \"What were they when they were one\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>She will look you in the eye and speak the answer in incredible detail It will be unlike anything you have ever heard leaving you on the verge of both ecstasy and agony It is not uncommon for a Seeker to lose themselves in the euphoria But you mustn\'t let your focus break, and you must take special care not to look upon her tattooed chest. Your mind will tempt you to gaze upon it, but you must resist, for if you fail, she will flay you alive and add your mutilated flesh to her bindings, and you will remain trapped with her, fully conscious, for the rest of time.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That tattoo is Object 4 of 538.

(6, 'The Holder of Song', 'In any city in any country go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to When you reach the front desk ask to visit someone who calls herself \"The Holder of Song You will then be guided to a long staircase that spirals higher than the building stands At the stairs\' summit is a door.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you open the door, a sudden wave of heat will pour out from the hallway beyond it, and wash over you. Proceed down the hallway. As you walk, the air around you will grow increasingly frigid. When you feel as if you are encased in ice, you must stand perfectly still, remain silent, and listen. If, after a few seconds pass, you hear a baby crying, turn and run. No harm will befall you, but the infant\'s cry will follow you wherever you go If you hear it for the rest of your life count yourself lucky if and when it stops your firstborn child will die\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you do not hear a baby\'s cry, wait for the hallway to grow warm once more, and then proceed to the door at its end. Enter.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The room beyond will be awash in green light. At its center will be an old woman turning the handle of a silent music box. Her legs have both been severed at the knees. When you speak to her, you must look her in the eyes. She hides a spear fashioned from the bones of her legs; break eye contact, and she will impale you with it and leave you to bleed to death in seemingly unending agony. She will respond to only one question: \"What was the song they used to play?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The old woman will begin to sing in a language not of this world. Her melody will be the most beautiful one you have ever heard, bringing peace and serenity to your mind, body, and soul. You will find yourself vividly imagining a band of carefree children playing and singing, innocent as can be... And within minutes, the scene will eventually take a horribly sinister turn. The children will begin to fight each other, and their conflict will quickly escalate to the most brutal, lethal violence you can conceive of. They will impale each other on wooden poles, disembowel each other with sharp rocks, and even rip flesh from bone with their bare hands. You will witness these children, now merely tattered doppelgangers of themselves, spreading death and destruction more horrific than you could ever imagine on your own. You will see a naked boy, drenched in blood, singing with delight as he runs through a hellish wasteland, pursued by unspeakable monsters. They will overtake him and utterly destroy him, the song still issuing forth from his shredded lips all the while.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>...Yet, inexplicably, you will remain calm and peaceful even as you watch this unspeakable brutality.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>When these horrific visions end, an intense pain will stab at your chest. Your heart will feel like it is about to explode. Do not let the agony break your focus, and do not break eye contact with the old woman, lest you invite a fate so horrible that an exploding heart seems lovely by comparison. If you remain steadfast in your gaze, the pain will eventually cease. The woman will stand up (though, with your eyes still focused on hers, you will know not how) and place the music box in your hands.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The music box is Object 6 of 538.

The walls will be covered with fine paintings, and a large marble statue will rest on a pedestal by the base of the stairs.

As long as you don\'t touch anything you will be safe Don\'t panic. At the top of the stairs, you will find a small, wooden door; its plain and unassuming appearance is a sharp contrast to its decadent surroundings. It will open on its own for you, so long as you are not afraid. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Past it, you will see a man with a pointed goatee and short, cropped, gelled hair standing behind a large, mahogany desk. His suit is made of both human flesh and Italian silk. He may speak, and at great length. He will talk about his amazingly beautiful house and the lovely statue of his concubine resting downstairs. Do not interrupt him, and do not answer any questions he may ask. When he is finished, steel yourself and confidently ask, \"May I have my salary?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will proceed to explain to you, in great detail, the value of life. He will talk of things worse than death, and he will tell you exactly what he expects you to do. The fabulous interior of the room will rot away, and the floor will turn from French weave to feces.

After another three minutes, his prayer will cease, and he will tell you how you will die. He will describe every minute detail of your horrible death, and you will be unable to move or react while he explains your end. Lastly, he will describe the one who will steal your life away from you, and go into such detail as to why it is necessary that you yourself will question which would be worse: you being murdered, or you being allowed to continue to live.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Eventually, the head will finish its ghastly tale.

Each will wear one glove and hold out both their hands to you.  Take only the gloved hand of each, for should you touch the black-clothed boy\'s flesh you will be plagued with the worst agony in all the universe but you will not die and he will not let go Should you touch the whiteclothed boy\'s flesh, you will feel more pleasure than you have ever experienced, but he will soon pull his hand away, and you will never feel that pleasure again, no matter how you yearn for it; your lust will kill you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The boys will look at each other and nod once; should they shake their heads, close your eyes and quickly say, \"I am not what you seek, but I can change the tides.\"  Once you say this, they will both giggle and pull on your hands, opening a trap door in their cell and descending into darkness.

If she should smile at you, you have amused her, and she will light up the entire room with her light and you will become one of the writhing bodies that makes up the collection beneath her glass floor.

They are to be your judges.  You must the pick the one that you feel will do you justice and walk towards them, asking along your way, \"When will they strip you of this earth?\"  Should you choose the wrong color, the one you have chosen will stand very still and smile at you eerily, and you will soon feel yourself slipping away into nothingness.

You must stab the end of your forefinger with it. You will feel unbearable pain in your finger, but be pleased that I have lessened the pain for you, otherwise you would have had pain throughout your body. You must bear the pain however, and though the blood will not clot the finger, you will not run out of blood, for you are in my realm. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After which, you must draw me a pentagram, 6 feet circumference, with the tip of the star pointing me. Make sure it is good, I am a ruthless judge. (You are allowed to plan and measure.) \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When you are done, I shall look upon it. One of two things will happen. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>One: I turn and close my eyes in disgust; if this happens, the pentagram will catch ablaze. As your blood on the ground burns, so shall the remaining blood in your body. Your veins shall burn for all eternity, in the center of the pentagram, the pain never leaving. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Two: I like your art, and Smile. I will turn to you and Smile. My eyes will blacken, dark, shadowy tendrils will come from my mouth, and form a hellish grin. You will realise that the same is happening to you, and that I have just infected you with my Disease. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When the blackening will cease to flow from your body, it will have turned night; stare only at the pentagram. A demonic audience is watching you, and they tend to rip people to shreds if they look at them, so keep your gaze fixed upon the pentagram. They will dance around you in a devilish flurry, taunting you, mocking you, spitting on you and the like. If you remain stoic, then they will leave. After they have all left, the blackening will return, and ignite a random number of candles around the pentagram. Count and remember this number; it will serve you well at The End. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The light will return and you will awaken outside of the morgue, around mid-day. The cut on your finger will have healed, and it will the exact number of candles that will dictate how many days have gone by.

You now hold the power to summon the Blackening within you at will, the same you saw in my face during the third test. The ones who gaze at your face when it appears will slowly be consumed by the Blackening, the Disease. Every time you summon the Blackening, you will feel the pain you felt on your finger, over your whole body, increased tenfold. You will not pass out, but the pain will be unbearable. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The Disease is object 50 of 538. With it, you can Blacken anyone, even the immortal... <br><br>');

He will lead you down an ancient, creaking staircase made of wooden planks. It remains somehow suspended in an impossibly large room, the sides or bottom of which you will not be able to fathom. The only light will be from the quickly receding entryway. Vast, hulking shapes lumber in the darkness - I recommend that you do not make any noises louder than the gentle squeaking of the stairs. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Your guide will remain only a few steps ahead of you, but in the oppressive darkness his features remain unclear.

The demon at your back will have been slain. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>This next moment is crucial.

He appears rather young and is holding an ornately crafted, 18th century pistol in his right hand. He has several large tomes strapped to the saddlebags of his horse and bits of script in a foreign language are visible pasted, in a fashionable way, to various bits of his clothing. He will slowly approach you, making no move to dismount, but visibly interested in your appearance. You must hold his gaze until he disappears in the opposite direction. Following this exchange your exhaustion will suddenly catch up with you, and you will find it increasingly difficult to stay awake.

His contagious despair will punch through your skin, slither past your flesh and pierce through your bones, but take heed not to lose your focus - he is still their slave and his corrupted side will readily consume you if given the opportunity.

The wall to your left will have many doors. Do not open any of them under any circumstances, regardless of what sensations you feel urging you to do so. These feelings are scarcely more than base trickery. The doors restrain segments of your psyche mercifully shut away; to free them now is a grave mistake. The wall to your right is composed entirely of glass. Looking out this enormous window reveals whatever place you were born in, though entirely empty and devoid of life.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Walk the hallway. Its length is variable, so this may take even longer than your recent climb. At the opposite end, you will see a set of double doors.

The sound will seem impossibly loud, and will be accompanied by a blinding flash of light. He will be gone, and in his place, two other people will have appeared. To your left stands the object of your hatred: whomever you have borne more resentment towards than any other you have known. To your right, the one most dear to you. Living or dead, these people will appear in the flesh in front of you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Approach your mortal enemy, and wordlessly, he will hand you a knife.

Opening it will yield you nothing but a bemused smile from the secretary, as it will be empty. After a moment, she will draw your attention back to her and lead you into the principal\'s office After a few muttered words between the two the principal will welcome you with a handshake and proceed to open a trapdoor concealed under his desk He will hand you a dagger and offer a few grim words of luck before lowering you into the hole and closing the door For a moment you will be in total darkness but images will soon emerge in front of you You will recognize them as moments from your own life and as you watch you may come to realize that they are all connected Every moment of your life has culminated in this very moment and it is only with this realization that proceeding forward will become possible But worry not for this is a timeless place \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When you have accepted your fate a door will appear in front of you Through it is a single room with a closed door at the far end blocked off from you by a gate Once you are clear of the door you entered from it will slam shut and a person will materialize in front of you Confused they may prompt you for an explanation but regardless of your answer a fight will inevitably begin If at any time during the fight should your opponent\'s stomach be revealed, you will see that your own name is inscribed there. What this means, however, cannot be told. This battle will be one of the few moments of your life that is not scripted, and you will be well aware of the fact, as even moving your body will feel far more difficult than usual. Fortunately, the same holds true for your foe. Should you win the battle, the door at the far end of the room will open, and the gate will disappear. Fate will have lost its hold on you by this point, and what will happen to you beyond that door is beyond the knowledge of any being, but you can be certain that the chances of surviving without fate on your side are questionable at best. What is known, however, is that if you are an extremely lucky soul, you will eventually come to an ancient, rotting door. The doorknob will be lying on the ground before it, having long since rusted over and fallen from its place. One solid push is all it will take to open this door, and a cloud of dust will rise from the ground where it falls. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After the dust clears and you enter the room, you will be in an earthen cave. A small window, if it can be called that, will provide enough light for you to see three figures in the center of the room. The figures on the left and right, you will see as you draw closer, have been dead for many years. A stone is lodged in the skull of one, and the head of the second hangs at an awkward angle, its neck clearly broken. The figure in the center, however, still lives, despite its appearance, which clearly indicates that this being should have died centuries ago. The old crone, for that is what the center figure is, has only one eye. No ordinary eye, mind you, as it seems to shine with an otherworldly brilliance. Ask her this, and only this, lest she end your life in a manner so horrible that your worst fears would seem a blessing in comparison: \"What do you see?\" She will answer at her own pace, and impatience on your part will bring the full force of her considerable wrath upon you.  When she finally speaks, it will be in a tortured voice. She will tell you that she sees everything, but that she had lost sight of you as soon as your earlier battle started. Deciding that you are too great of a threat, she will attack you, with speed and strength seemingly impossible for her decrepit body to possess. You must act quickly, as one hit from her will destroy you utterly. Take the box you received earlier and open it. Be warned, though; the contents of that once empty box are not fit for human eyes, and if yours happen to be open when they emerge, your existence will end in a most terrifying manner. Once the box is opened, you will hear unearthly sounds. When they cease, close the box and open your eyes, but not a moment before. Looking around, nothing will have changed but for the crone. Time has caught up with her, as she will now be as dead as the other two figures in this room. Her eye is nowhere to be seen. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You now have two choices. Opening the box a second time will reveal an object that will grant you the power to control the past, present and future of the world, save for the room you reside in, and the ones you passed through after your battle. However, should you do this, you will be trapped in this room for all eternity, with no conceivable escape. Your second choice is to leave the room and brave whatever horrors you faced in order to get there. In either case, fate will no longer have any control over your life. Not long after, you will discover what a sickening burden it truly is to control your own destiny.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The Object that now lies within the box is number 76 of 538. There are some who are now aware of its existence.  May it never fall into the wrong hands. <br><br>'),

Perhaps she will touch your shoulder or arm, or perhaps she will tug on your pant-leg. Turn to face her, although she will not be there. You will find a run-down shack directly across or down the road from you. If a forbidding air seems to push you away from it, you know you have found the place. If you wish to spare yourself the innumerable horrors of the 2538 objects, turn back now. No-one will think the less of you. However, if you are brave, steel yourself and knock upon the plastic-siding door. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>It will slide back, revealing a beautiful woman in an elegant dress. Her eyes will be dark-ringed from lack of sleep, and red from crying for so many years. So many years. And those brown eyes were so vivid once. She will ask you if you truly believe in them. Tell her the truth, for if you are lying to her this day she will know, and your quest will end here. If you do tell her the truth, and she likes your answer, then she will invite you in. Remove your shoes once inside. She is a neat freak and would be angry if you tracked anything on the carpet. Yes, the inside of this ramshackle place will be opulent, bedecked in marble, gold, silks, and fine woods. Some exist here who remember building this for her. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Touch nothing as she escorts you into her lounge. Especially not the crystals. Once inside the lounge, sit at the low table as she reclines opposite you. This table is shaped like a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200929160937/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagua_(concept)\" class=\"extpage\">bagua<img src=\"/web/20200929160937im_/http://theholders.org/images/extlink.png\" border=\"0\"></a>, with a crystal ball in the center and feet made from effigies of the other Objects. Do not look at them. Do not touch the ball. There will be time for this yet. She will ask you questions, deep questions about your dark secrets. Questions that will lay bare your every sin and failure. If she begins to cry, know this: she weeps for you, and she weeps for herself. Do not console her. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After a while, she will touch the crystal ball. Do so as well. She will ask your name. Give it in full. Your name will drift away into the crystal ball. She will ask your birthdate. Give it. It too, will drift away. She will ask you for your titles, your pseudonyms, your screennames, your nicknames. All will float away from you and into her crystal ball. When she bids you rise, do so, and follow her to her bedchamber. Here, she will lay out clothes on the bed and step outside, still clutching her crystal ball. Strip yourself naked in front of the mirror. Do not leave a single ring on your finger, or in your ear. You must be bare of all but your skin. Throw your clothes into the unlit fireplace. Dress yourself in the clothes that she laid out for you. Your fate will be sealed by the colors of the garments. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Lie down in the bed. Do not lie on your side or on your stomach, for if you do, you will stay there for all eternity, never able to sleep, but experiencing every nightmare there ever was or will be in every moment. Lie still for four minutes and thirteen seconds. If you stir, she will not come. When she does come she will be wearing the same clothes that you are, and her raven black hair will be deftly brushed. Her makeup will be done to a tee, and she will look ever so beautiful. This is your last glimpse of true beauty before your long journey of horror. She will toss your shoes into the fireplace and light it, burning all of your clothes and belongings. She will then lay down next to you in the bed, smoothing back your hair as a mother might her child. Watch in stillness as hundreds of grotesque servants enter the room. Do not look them in their pain-wracked eyes. Do not listen to their sullen murmurings. For if you do, they will make sounds that will slowly and painfully melt your every bone. They will then take your frameless form from the bed and consume you alive, inconsiderate and unworthy person you are. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>As long as you do not do these things, and you allow her to pet you, and you stay absolutely still, you may watch as these servants in their black clothing bring in your every belonging and throw it into the fire. Do not weep for the loss of these things. The worst is yet to come. When all your things have burned to cinders, she will roll over and straddle your waist. She will then poke and prod your muscles and nerves. At times she will seem to poke at your very marrow. She will then rise to her full height and say, \"You know what it is you must ask. Ask it.\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Ask her \"Am I the One Chosen to Seek Them?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>This may yet be your last moment with your mind, heart, soul and body intact. She will likely begin to cry ever harder. Her tears will splash down on your chest. She will begin to massage her tears into your skin. If at this point her nails dig into you, know that your every lie this day has been discovered. Foul creature, how could you lie to her? Her tears will leak into your veins and dissolve your will into a screaming husk, and you will serve to carry people\'s belongings for all eternity but never have any of your own\r\n<br>\r\n<br>She may look down at you in pity for you have come so far and experienced unimaginable horrors and have even told the absolute truth to her but you are not the Chosen She will apologize for what has been done to you and what you may have been forced to do She will then ask you \"Do you want to forget\" You may respond in one of three ways If you say yes all your belongings will be returned to you You will be returned to your home and will have no memory of the Holders the Objects or the horrors you have witnessed in seeking them If you say no as some do her house will vanish from around you You will have no clothes and no belongings but you will have knowledge of the Objects as well as whatever Objects you have already collected If you seek to collect them for personal gain this is the option to choose However you may say \"No but I wish to aid the Chosen\" In this case she will tell you the name and location of the Chosen You must immediately seek him out tell him of the Bride and turn over to him whatever Objects you possess After this as with the \"yes\" answer you will be returned to your home with all your belongings and no memory of the Holders\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If however she bends over and kisses you on the lips and your white garments touch hers know that you have been chosen She will tell you of the Holders who have been lost to documentation She will tell you the proper order in which to approach the Holders so that you may seek Them And by seeking Them seek Him She will then whisper into your ear your new name your name as the Seeker of Holders Know now that every person who knows of you will not remember any name pseudonym nickname or screenname you gave or ever will give them Only your name as the Seeker of Holders If you stand at the footsteps of any mental institution or halfway house and ask the wind to bring you the Bride of the Seeker her home will appear for you as a haven from your troubles \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You are now object 90 out of 538 the Seeker of Holders Whether you seek to gather them or destroy them we who have gone before you pray for your soul \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Do not let us down <br><br>'),

Only with their infernal strength will you survive this task. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you remain, the attendant will ask you to check the church at the end of the street, and return to his paperwork. Leave the building and walk leisurely down the street, and enjoy what may be your final moments alive. When you reach the end of the road, you will see an old, dilapidated structure that may have been a house of worship a long time past. Enter the door carefully, lest the frame collapse on you. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will be surrounded by light, and taken to the place where the objects you have gathered lay before you, along with two doors. Know now that if you lack the <a href=\"?Holder_of_Hate\" class=\"yespage\">Cloak</a>, the <a href=\"?Holder_of_Confusion\" class=\"yespage\">Beast\'s Resolve</a> the Shield <a href\"HolderofSolitude\" class\"yespage\">Holder of Solitude</a> or <a href\"HolderoftheShield\" class\"yespage\">Holder of the Shield</a> or the <a href\"HolderofPeace\" class\"yespage\">Sword</a> then take the door on the left and leave for you are doomed to fail If you possess one or more of these Objects then choose one and enter the door to your right \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will pass into a hellish expanse of wasteland its horizon surging with infernal flames and showers of blood pounding the barren ground beneath your feet Far in the distance a tall structure juts out its stark and polished whiteness blaring its presence to everything here And rest assured you are not alone \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will only have a handful of seconds to take in these sights before a horde of demons begins to rush towards you If you carry the cloak with you drape it over yourself and walk towards the building the creatures are an extension of the Holder who sees you through their hatred Otherwise arm yourself with the plain sword that appears at your feet as the king\'s blade will not come free should you wear it. The demons are numerous, but frail; they exist only as a thought, and one stroke will cleave them apart. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>No matter how you do so, it will take a very long time to reach the structure, but you will never find yourself tired from the exertions of moving or fighting - conflict is the food of life here, and you are part of its source. When you climb onto the first step of the entrance, the endless swarm of creatures pouring from its doors will finally halt, and the crowd that eagerly pressed against itself to flay you will calm and watch your every movement as you ascend to the large, opulent doors. They will part as you walk, forming a silent, vigilant ring that urges you toward their keeper. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The inside is just as lavish as its outer shell, dressed in fine fabrics and frescoes, beautiful statues, and beautiful mosaics inlaid into the floor. The Holder\'s minions will form a solid path from which you should not dare deviate they are much more resilient here within their home Follow your only sensible option for as long as it leads you but do not turn back or make to leave Your passage will lead to a spacious and stark room dotted only by a throne and two figures a naked beautiful brownskinned woman reclining in the seat and a pale man bedecked in armor kneeling on the floor in front of her Instantly you will feel a lust you have never felt before Ignore it or you will be flayed by the knight for your insolence\r\n<br> \r\n<br>Instead state without fear that you have come to answer the challenge With a wave of the woman the knight will rise don a helmet and bring sword and shield to bear Should you possess the sword the blade you were given will morph into a round shield and your own weapon will let itself be drawn Should you lack the sword the knight will toss one to you a shield letting it slide to a halt at your feet One way or another when you have equipped yourself properly a suit of half plate will form around you and the knight will charge \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Now it is up to you and your skills If you chose the sword know that his armor alone will not save him as the king\'s blade will batter and eventually pierce the heavy metal. If you opted to take the shield, then do not fear the knight\'s blade for it cannot break the hellish protector But whatever you decided be aware that the knight is a very formidable opponent he will use any means he can to defeat you whether it be his blade his shield or punishing steelhardened strikes from his hands and feet To best the knight you must cleave his sword arm from his body only then will he yield kneeling to you and ignoring the mangled bleeding stump \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you are victorious the woman will rise and walk towards you Kneel and hold your weapon tight in your hand She will tell you \"Obey the strong destroy the weak\" Now ignoring your temptation ram the blade through her gut and wrench it upwards heeding your temptation will only result in your being lost in eternal bliss and any objects you have collected will return to their holders As her body slumps to the floor sheathe your blade and offer the knight his missing arm As he holds it back to the wound his armor will shatter revealing him to be a humanoid figure with fireblackened skin golden hair and deep amethyst eyes that bore into your soul \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will compliment you on your fight and on seeing through his master\'s illusion. He will speak, in length, of the measures that were placed in this realm to guard the Object here, and how he extended them through himself. When he finishes, he will permit you to ask one question. You must request of him, \"Why do you follow Him, my lord?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The Holder will seat himself as he tells you, in a gravelly voice that holds the weight of ages of vows, how he fought his way into His favor, and describe, in painful detail, how he fought Him and lost. The words will take shape as the hell knight speaks, burning the images of the entire story into your memory. The Holder will explain the agonizing torture he suffered, and you shall feel his pain as he speaks. If your mind cannot endure this, then you will take the dead woman\'s place as the Holder\'s next decoy, but if you persevere, then the Holder will tell you the vow he took to escape the unending torment. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When this is finished, he will stand and offer you the only remaining piece of his armor; the gauntlet, which is still pristine despite the battle. Replace yours with the one you are offered. Then, the Holder will advise you to arm yourself again, for you must fight your way to the entrance of his home. Only when you are ready will he order his minions to attack. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you chose to carry the Beast\'s Resolve it will manifest itself now surging though your body and lending you the strength of the most fearsome of demons Otherwise it will be a long and savage battle to the front door If you manage to reach the foyer alive and rend through the frenzy around you to the door white light will surround you yanking you across dimensions and dropping you outside the wrecked church Everything will be gone your chosen Object returned to its place of Holding but the knight\'s gift will remain. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That gauntlet is Object 91 of 538, the Hand of Obedience.

Relax, for now the Holder is pleased with you. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When your relaxation has drifted you off into a state of utter bliss, the ash-fruit will be withdrawn from your mouth.

The hands that once caressed you will hold you tightly, almost painfully. you will be tilted into a vertical position and the long eye-stalks of the Holder will poke into your limited view.

Do not look at the eyes or hands, no matter what they do. Do not listen to the whispers coming from the hands on the side of your head.

He shall not complain or even try to stop you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>After going through the door, you will find yourself in a dark hallway. As you walk down it, you must walk at a steady pace. You will define the speed with which you have to walk: if you walk very fast, you will have to keep moving fast. If you move slowly, you will have to keep moving slowly. Failure to comply will result with instant death.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>At the end of the hallway, there are three paths. The centre path leads to the Holder. The path on the left leads back home, but the path back shall be painful beyond imagination. The path on the right leads to certain death, yet the death is painless and many consider this a more suitable fate than the painful journey back or the suffering in order to get the object.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you chose the centre path, you will walk on until you see a large, rectangular room in front of you. A man is sitting in a chair at the centre of the room, surrounded by chalk circles drawn into the floor. One circle for each object you have. If you have 5 objects, there are 5 circles. If you have 45 objects, there are 45 circles.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Walk towards the Holder. Be prepared, because he will shout at you in a large booming voice. His demand is simple: place the first object in the first circle. If you obey, and surrender the object to the Holder, the object placed in the circle will be gone and you will be required to get it again.  If you survive. If you refuse, the Holder will lift his hand and countless, minuscule hooks shall go into each of your pores. The pain will make you believe that you are being torn apart. If the pain stops and you have not gone mad with the agony, or have not screamed at him to take your object, he shall smile and say you are worthy of keeping the object. The process will repeat until he has asked for all of your objects. For objects that are too large to move, immaterial, or are otherwise impossible to be placed in a circle, the Holder shall ask if you want to place it in the circle. If you agree, the object will be lost, if you disagree, you shall be tortured once more. If you remain strong and he deems you worthy enough to keep them all, one of the hooks used in your many torture sessions will increase in size until it is the size of a normal fishing hook.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The hook is Object 113 of 538. Its only purpose is to get others to surrender their objects.\r\n<br> <br><br>');

(114, 'Holder of Reincarnation', 'In any city, in any country, go to any Hindu shrine or Buddhist temple you can get yourself to. When you arrive, ask the high priest or chief monk to see someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Reincarnation.\" If they tell you that there is nobody there by that name, leave post-haste; it is best left unsaid what happens if you linger too long. If you make it out successfully, never return to any Buddhist temple or Hindu shrine until someone close to you dies; after their funeral, you may try again. You may have to do this multiple times.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If they instead say, \"Indeed, it is so easy to understand, yet so impossible to destroy,\" you are fortunate enough to have located the Holder. The priest or monk should then lead you deep into the shrine or temple. Eventually you\'ll reach a hallway that seems... well, let\'s just use the phrase \"out of place.\" On the left wall, you\'ll see people dying the most gruesome of deaths. Coinciding with their deaths, you\'ll see the most foul creatures you\'ve yet seen spawning on the right wall. This is where the minions of every Holder are generated; they are the reincarnations of the most foul, damned men who have ever walked the earth. Take care not to focus your attention on any one creature, for they don\'t like to be seen in their \"incomplete\" state and will test their newfound powers on you without hesitation.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you progress down the hall, the people on the left will become more evil and the creatures on the right more revolting and hideous. Eventually, their power will feel overbearing, and you\'ll lose all desire to continue. Despite this, you must press onwards, for you don\'t want these beasts to sense your weakness.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Should you successfully reach the end, you\'ll find yourself standing in front of a door that seems to be made of parts of every living creature ever formed on earth. The priest or monk will move to open the door; <i>make sure</i>, above all else, that you open the door first. Should he open the door, the Holder will mistake him for the Seeker and will nail you, a mere intruder, to the wall with the damned men. If this happens, then hope you enjoy your new life as a Holder\'s minion. Should you open the door first, the monk or priest who accompanied you will suffer this fate in your stead.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Enter the room beyond; the door will shut behind you, silencing the wails of the condemned men and the howls of the newly-formed monsters. You will find yourself in a round chamber; on the stone walls is a series of moving lights that spiral upwards into infinity; don\'t follow the lights with your gaze, lest you be driven mad by the infinitude of it all. Standing in the center of the room is a being that is half-man. The other half is something so vile and horrendous that to gaze directly at it would mean an eternal life as an inconsolable, broken wretch. Wait patiently in this room with the creature; don\'t say anything or do anything save breathing, or the being will disappear, the floor will drop beneath you, and you\'ll fall downwards forever, witnessing every death and concurrent birth in the world all the while.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Suddenly, without warning, the being will lunge at you as if to attack. The only means of sparing yourself a fate best left unspoken is to ask, at this precise moment, \"Can any of Them be permanently destroyed?\" The being should then halt in its tracks, then tell you of mankind\'s futile efforts to break the wheel of samsara, that everlasting spiral of death and rebirth. He will provide solid evidence that the Buddha, the only human said to have ever escaped the cycle, was a fraud (you will then remember that he was the last of the condemned souls dying to form the Holders\' new legions). Suddenly you will realize that the spiraling lights around you are the physical manifestation of samsara. All this knowledge is too much for the average mind to comprehend; indeed, you may find yourself in a sudden \"blank\" state, your brain now unable to perform any tasks outside of maintaining your vitals (and even that will soon end). If your mind is above ordinary, however, break off one of the man\'s claws (if indeed that is what they can be called) and use it to slash a gaping hole into the chain of samsara. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Upon doing this, the Holder will cease to exist (for the cycle that reincarnation depends on is now no more), and he will leave behind a platinum swastika charm on a golden chain. Upon taking it, you\'ll find yourself outside any Hindu shrine or Buddhist temple save the one you started your journey in (though you should notice that it\'s in ruins). Good luck finding your way home.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That swastika charm is Object 114 of 538. Departed souls still need a place to go, you know. <br><br>'),
(115, 'Holder of Pestilence', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Pestilence\". At this point, the worker should gag, and try not to vomit. After several minutes of this, the worker will finally give in, vomiting into a wastepaper basket. They will then stand, and lead you down the hallway. You will reach a door, slightly ajar, but you must <i>not</i> touch it. To do so would invite its curse into your bones, and your fate would be sealed. Instead, demand that the worker open it for you. Pass quickly through the door â€“ the Holder is waiting. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will find yourself in a darkened room. The door behind you will slam shut â€“ again, to touch it would be to invite the Rot. Instead, walk ahead, in the dark, until you reach what feels like a stone altar. Reach over, until you find a groove. At this point, you must think only of home, and your friends, and the people you love, as something cold and wet will slide momentarily over your face. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After the deathly embrace is over, you will find the groove has split open, and the altar now reveals a staircase. Descend it, taking care not to trip. The Holder wouldnâ€™t want you damaged before you meet. Finally, at the bottom of the stairs, it is vital that you donâ€™t step off the final step. Instead, look as hard as you can until you see footsteps cleared among the ichor and rot coating the floor. Step only in these, as to touch the Rot is to join it. As you make your way forward, you will finally come to a stone sarcophagus. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Few people realize this, but the word \'Sarcophagus\' means \'Eater of Flesh\', and this is exactly what this coffin is. You must raise the stone lid, and lower yourself into it. Hold still. Itâ€™s sleeping. After a few moments, the room will be lit, ambient light slowly filling the room. You <i>must</i> remain still. If it wakes, all is lost. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After the room is lit to its brightest, you will hear a tapping noise, like someone is walking into the room, however, you will be unable to hear them. As the footsteps get nearer and nearer, you will hear a rasping voice speaking in an unknown language. At this point, most Seekers will find it important not to focus on the words, as they tell of truths mortals cannot comprehend. Finally, the speaker is silent. The base of the sarcophagus will raise, and it is now safe to move. The Holder is standing here. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>His skin is gangrenous and blackened, and his eyes are sunken. He will speak to you, in your native language, and ask you a series of questions about yourself. Answer truthfully, and your mind will remain intact. The Holder will ask you to hold out your left hand. He will reach out and place something cold into your palm, and then close your hand over it. For his ravaged appearance, the Holder is not an evil being, and wishes you luck. A door is now behind you. Passing through it will bring you back to the institution through which you passed. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The jewel in your hand is Object 115 of 538. Dare you wield the Rot-Stone unprotected? <br><br>'),
(116, 'Holder of Guilt', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls herself \"The Holder of Guilt\". Before the worker can answer, shut your eyes tightly and clench your jaw. Count to exactly twenty, then open your eyes. You should find yourself on an unassuming dirt footpath in a moderately wooded area. If you are in any other location, then you miscounted the seconds and have only minutes to live. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you are on the dirt path, then walk along it. You should feel, at all times, an eddy of wind playing against your ear. Should you ever stop feeling it, quickly stand still and shout into the foliage, \"I freely admit it was my fault!\" If the little eddy of wind does not return, then I suggest you make yourself comfortable and arm yourself, as these woods are now your home for all eternity, and they are filled to bursting with hidden creatures from the lowest pits of damnation, all eager to messily devour you. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the wind does return, then continue along the path as normal. After a long while you should find a battered little shanty. Knock twice before entering; failing to knock properly beforehand results in a punishment that cannot be adequately described in any human tongue. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Upon entering the shanty, you will find yourself in a clean little kitchen. Quickly shut the door behind you and remain standing, head bowed respectfully, where you entered. Fervently working the kitchen will be a woman who never turns to face you as she goes about her endless task of working on a meal that will never be finished. If you pay attention, you will notice that she works to an exact rhythm, but this is not terribly important - just an interesting detail. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>There is only one question to which this woman will respond: \"Why is it their fate to be used for wrong?\" Give her a moment; it will take a while before she gets around to answering. When she does, she will recount in your mother\'s voice (even if you have never heard your mother\'s voice), and in explicit detail, every wrong you have ever visited upon others, no matter how trivial, no matter if it was intentional or unintentional. No matter how shameless, unrepentant, or vile a person you are, or even if your wrongdoings are few or barely extant, you will feel the weight of your wrongdoing pressing down on you. Remain standing in your respectful pose even as the weight of your wrong increases to unbearable levels. If ever you falter, you will be crushed, doomed to remain a broken heap on the floor of this kitchen listening to the woman repeat herself forever. Then again, that would mean you were never worthy of collecting all the Objects in the first place. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once every wrong has been recited in excruciating detail, if you are still standing, the woman will ask you to retrieve an ingredient from a top cupboard. Go fetch it. <i>Do not</i> open any cupboard other than the one indicated, and <i>do not</i> turn your head in a way that would allow you to see the woman\'s face. There are fates worse than what would happen if you do either, but the list is very short. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The ingredient she is looking for is the only spice that has no label. Hand it to her in a way that prevents you from looking her in the face, then return to where you were standing earlier. Wait a while, and she will eventually offer a small sample of her cooking for you to eat. Walk over to her and accept it (being careful not to put yourself in a position to see her face). It is a sizable chunk of cooked beef. Thank her politely, tell her you had a wonderful time visiting and will come back another day, then quietly leave via the door through which you came. You will find you have walked out of a supply closet in the mental institution. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The food you acquired from the Holder is no ordinary beef. It never rots, no matter how old it gets, and eating even a small bite of it will instantly heal all your wounds, no matter how grave. It does this, however, by transferring said wounds to someone you care deeply about. Survival in the future of this quest will make eating this beef necessary at least a few times. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That chunk of cooked beef is Object 116 of 538. Hopefully the Objects are important enough to sacrifice people you genuinely care about. <br><br>'),
(117, 'Holder of the Syzygy', 'In any city, in any country, go to any warehouse or factory you can get yourself to. When you reach the receiving desk, ask to claim the shipment for someone called \"The Holder of the Syzygy.\" The secretary will not believe you in the slightest, but be resolute and if necessary ask to speak to the foreman. He will arrive in time, and will also mock you, saying he\'s never heard of such a person. Be patient and he will eventually consult the records, the color draining from his face when he finds the name in his papers. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will then lead you onto the floor of the factory, but he will demand that you wear eye protection. You should have the <a href=\"?Holder_of_the_Lens\" class=\"yespage\">Eyes</a> by now, and though this is not their true purpose, only they will suffice for this occasion. If you do not have the Eyes, you will be wasting your time and your life. <a href=\"?Holder_of_the_Lens\" class=\"yespage\">Put on the Eyes</a> before following him. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The foreman will lead you to the oldest and furthest section of the factory. There will be seemingly endless rows of boxes and crates here, but do not break stride and do not examine the labels and destinations on any of them. You will find them to be years, even decades old, with strange destinations and even stranger contents, but they are valueless in your quest. Instead, keep your eyes fixed on the foreman. He will be eager to lose you around the next row of musty cardboard pallets. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After what might seem like a day\'s worth of walking down never-ending aisles, the foreman will stop before a single, massive crate. It is wooden but does not appear to be made from individual planks, instead, it looks as though carved from a single massive piece of the darkest wood imaginable, almost black. Set into the box is a door. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the crate emits a high pitched whine, a kind of buzzing noise, or seems to vibrate slightly, then you can breathe a quick sigh of relief that what is inside is still what you seek. But if the air by this box is filled with only silence, or any other sound, then what you seek within has been destroyed, and you may now search the crates nearby for some instrument to end your life, for you have no hope of leaving this modern labyrinth. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will find the door unlocked; you need not even knock before entering. You will then be standing in complete darkness; only the Eyes will reveal the true nature of the space you are now standing in. You will find yourself standing near the center of a massive web of rings, all centered around a small dais with a reclining chair, not unlike a dentist\'s chair. The difference in function becomes terrifyingly apparent as you approach--the chair is surrounded by hundreds of scalpels, each on its own articulated arm, poised above the chair. Strapped in to the seat is a mannequin made of the same dark wood the crate was fabricated from. Where the face of the mannequin should be, however, is carved a divot like a bowl. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Use one of the scalpels to cut yourself and add a few drops of your blood to this bowl. Immediately, the mannequin\'s body will turn from wood into flesh, and its appearance will be yours. You should stand back as the scalpels descend, making a frenzy of cuts on your doppelganger\'s body. You will hear your own screams, the flesh that is sliced will be yours and not yours. At this moment, the rings will shift in the vast darkness around you, eventually ceasing in their alignment at some point. Some will remain frozen in the air above or below you, while many others will settle themselves in a neat row on the horizon. The number of marks on the mannequin-you\'s flesh is the number of Objects you have gathered; the rings show your progress the same way. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The mannequin-you will curse and plead for you to stop the pain or end its suffering, but you must coldly ask it, \"When will they align?\" The not-you will beg, plead, and grovel for mercy as the scalpels slowly start to descend, crying for you to stop it, but you must say nothing and must not look away. This time, the blades will make five hundred and thirty-eight slices, all but flaying the mannequin-you to ribbons. The rings will now all be aligned on the horizon, and a long light will land on the dais, showing you the way home. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Before you leave, take from the ruined chest of the mannequin-you a small leather-bound book. Then follow the light until you find yourself outside the factory once more. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The star atlas you now hold is Object 117 of 538.

(118, 'Holder of Joy', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Joy\". The worker will shudder violently and ask that you reconsider. Insist gently, and he will reluctantly relent. He will open a hatch on the ceiling above you, and offer to boost you up through it. Accept his offer. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Upon emerging from the hatch, you will find yourself in an old factory, similar to the old 18th-century sweatshops of large American east coast cities. It is dirty and dimly lit, and the noise of the machines will be so loud you will find yourself incapable of thought. Before you will be a long catwalk over the large factory floor filled with massive machines; walk along that catwalk. Working the many hot, hellish, and clattering machines are small children, though they are so weary and ragged you might mistake them for elderly people. In what little light there is you can make out their filthy, pleading faces, full of desperation and a wish to be free from their endless torment. Just keep walking; no mortal can help them, and should you attempt to do so you will join them in their eternal and pointless labor. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>It will take a long time, but eventually you will reach a door to the foreman\'s office. Enter to find a plain, gruff man, built like a brick, who appears to be in his late 40s and is wearing a rather plain white button-up shirt. Once he notices you, he will look up from whatever he was doing and regard you with a disgusted glare. With confidence, ask him one question: \"Can any joy come from it?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once the question has been asked, the foreman will stand and leave the office. Follow him. You will both be on the catwalk once again, whereupon he will shout a command to the child workers. What he says exactly will be lost in the din of machinery, but the child laborers will understand. The children will throw themselves into the machinery, altering the sound in horrible ways. You will clearly hear the bones snap and muscles rip as the children are torn and crushed by the machines, into which they unquestioningly threw themselves. Throughout this nightmare spectacle, you will hear the Holder\'s voice explain the true nature of joy and pain, though I will not write it here for only the worthy may know it. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once all the child laborers have been thoroughly shredded by the hellish machinery, the foreman will tell you to go back to his office and wait for him there. Do as he says, and upon entering the office door you will find yourself in whatever place you most often sleep at night. On your bed (or whatever sleeping surface you use) will be a plain white button-up shirt just like the one the foreman wore. This shirt will bestow a sense of familiarity and camaraderie with those you speak to.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That shirt is Object 118 of 538. You now know joy, and as such, may never have it. <br><br>'),

When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Cowardice\". As the last syllable leaves your lips, the worker will immediately and roughly grab the collar of your shirt; let him, do not resist. He will shout incoherently at you while shaking you angrily. After some time of this, he will appear to calm down and let you go. He will beckon for you to walk down a staircase that was not there before. Walk down the stairs, even though they are impossibly dark. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will emerge into what appears to be a small garden. The worker will tell you to wait here, and will then go back the way he came, leaving you alone in the garden. Wait in that garden; feel free to stroll around it all you like and make yourself comfortable. After a long while - hours, perhaps - two men will appear where you are not looking. One man is tall, brawny, and handsome in a proud, heroic way, and wears a suit of knightly armor. The other is a mouse of a man: scrawny, balding, nearsighted, lacking any kind of posture, lacking a chin, and clad in a threadbare brown suit. Once you have laid eyes on these two men, remain still and betray no movement as they stare at you. Eventually the knight will make a gesture that indicates you may speak. At this gesture, ask one question: \"If we stop now, what is the price?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once the question is asked, the scrawny man will suddenly tackle the knight with immense strength and proceed to rip him apart with savage ease, using just his bare hands. The knight, in spite of his heroic and powerful appearance, will be helpless against the fury of the scrawny man, who will first tear away the knight\'s breastplate, then rip into the knight\'s body, spattering everything in the garden with blood and gore. When this happens, stand still and watch the entire meaningless slaughter, no matter how horrible the knight\'s cries of pain and pleas for mercy. Once the knight has been thoroughly rent asunder - he was a large man, so this will take a long time - everything - the garden, the scrawny man, and you - will be soaked red with the knight\'s blood. Then a young, beautiful girl, no older than seven years old, will appear. She is the knight\'s daughter. The blood-drenched scrawny man will gesture to her; he wants you to kill her in the exact same manner he killed the knight. Do it, or else the scrawny man will consider you in league with the knight, and you will be butchered next. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Set about slaughtering and ripping apart the little girl with your bare hands as the scrawny man wanted. The girl will not offer any physical resistance, though her crying and whimpering will be unbearable. As you commit this violent and senseless deed, the scrawny man will crouch down next to you and whisper into your ear, telling of every instance in human history where courage resulted in pain and death, and where cowardice only made matters worse. He will explain, in excruciating detail, the true consequences of courage and the true cost of cowardice. Once the little girl has been reduced to a lifeless red pulp by your own bare hands, the scrawny man will smile. He will pick up the dead knight\'s blood-spattered breastplate and hand it to you, then with a warm, friendly countenance gesture you to leave. Go through the door through which you came and make your way back to the institution. Once you have made it back, I suggest you find a way to clean yourself, your clothes, and the breastplate, as all are still coated thickly with the knight\'s blood. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The breastplate is Object 119 of 538.

It may be the last thing you see before you suffer an undying death, torn to shreds and meaty chunks no larger than pocket change... But you will still be conscious. You will feel everything as your remains are added to batter, then put in the hellish heat of the oven, unable to scream, unable to see, only aware of yourself roasting and eventually being slowly devoured and digested. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>It would be much, much wiser to accept. She will again smile charmingly. â€œLovely! Hand me that measuring cup.â€ \r\n<br>\r\n<br>All the while, stay by her side. Do not wander to the red side of the room, and do not touch any of the baked goods. Each time you begin to ask her a question, she will speak over you, asking for an item or for you to hold something. You must attempt to question her 12 times before she gathers all the ingredients. One too many or less, and you will suffer the undying death. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After collecting and mixing, she will cross over to the red side of the room. It is hot and uncomfortable here, and instantly, she will turn to her true form, as will the ingredients.

The worker will give a solemn, knowing nod and beckon you to follow him. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will lead you down a long hallway and eventually gesture for you to enter a door. Do not enter this door. Instead, enter the door on the exact opposite side of the hall. You will come upon another hallway. At the door you entered will be a man who is almost identical to the worker who led you, except this one is a mirror-image version, with all features reversed. Ask once again for the Holder, and this mirror worker will give a solemn, knowing nod and beckon you to follow. If you say anything else after this point, then this mirror world will collapse upon you, erasing all evidence that you ever existed. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The worker will take you back to the front desk and gesture for you to exit out the front door. Do this, and you will find yourself in an incalculably vast room. It will be impossible to determine the room\'s appearance or features, as it is filled with sourceless, eye searingly bright lights - too bright for your vision to adjust, so that the entire room appears to be a blaze. Just walk forward on ground that feels like sand.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Start walking in any direction into the room. Everything should be completely silent, but if at any point you hear a high whistle, like the sound of a teapot, then stop immediately and shout with all the ferocity you can muster, \"I can see what I must do!\" It is best you not know what eternal horrors await you should the whistling continue. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the whistling stops, however, then you are to proceed as you were. Eventually, no matter which direction you walked, you will come upon a small area of the vast room where the lights, by some strange means, are not quite as blinding. Sitting in a meditative cross-legged position in the exact middle of this area is a peaceful-looking thin man wearing nothing but a loincloth. He has not a single hair on his entire body, but it is his head that is truly unusual. He has neither nose nor ears, and his mouth has no lips, so that it is just a slit on his placid face. His eyes have odd pupils, exactly like those of a goat. This man will have his arms held forward and his hands clasped together as though hiding a small object between them. He will stare at you impassively until you ask one question: \"What lies in the depths of His heart?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The man with the goat eyes will give a knowing but benign grin, then open his hands. Darkness will flow out from them like a mist, very slowly filling the room. It is crucial that during this time you stare intently into the man\'s strange eyes, for otherwise you will be consumed by this darkness forever. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>As the darkness overwhelms the light, it will reveal the true forms of the goat-eyed man and this vast room. The man is a truly nightmarish specter, more bone than flesh, his countenance no longer suggesting peaceful benevolence but rather a dark and violent hatred. You will see in the distance the immense walls of this room; they are made up of a collage of anguished faces. These are the souls of every Seeker who has ever failed the test of any Holder. The visions of the man and the room will overwhelm your sight as a loud crackling sound, like that of a raging fire, overwhelm your ears. No matter what, though, you must keep your gaze fixed upon the man\'s eyes. After what seems like an eternity, the assault on your senses will stop abruptly, and the room will revert back to its light-filled state, the man once again a tranquil in meditation. The goat-eyed man\'s arms will be outstretched, presenting a little brown bag. Take the bag gently and give a respectful bow before turning to leave. Go back the way you came: back through the mirror world and into the hallway of the regular world. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The gelatinous substance in that bag is Object 121 of 538.

Run for your insignificant life, and do not stop until the sun rises the next morning. The medical interns have lost their patient, and are eager to find someone else to treat. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the Object you seek is still there, the patient will go into a massive seizure, and the medical staff accompanying him in the ambulance will try to save him. The patient will thrash violently, disemboweling the EMTs working on him using whatever is at hand. During this time, you must not move from your current position or the patient will come for you next. Once the patient has done away with his victims, you must ask one question, lest you be maimed for eternity: \"What was the price for longevity?\" The patient will then tell a horrific story, a story showing every malpractice, every accident, every excuse and every experiment in medical history that helped to bring about the convenience people enjoy today.

From the echoes that come from the doors will hear that the inhabitants of these rooms are busy doing something, though what this something is you donâ€™t know, and would be better off not knowing. The inhabitants scream intensely, seething with madness and obsession over their assigned tasks. These were the previous Seekers foolish enough to look into the windows or fail the Holderâ€™s test.

Youâ€™ll hear the sound of flesh tearing, bones breaking, and the crackling of great fires. Ignore all of this and continue toward the center. You will know that youâ€™re an inch from the creature once you cannot see anything and you cannot hear your own thoughts over the screams of the damned. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Through the madness all around you only one thing can stop it.

He will recount how with every step he took forward, the closer he came to insanity, being pushed by unseen forces, drilling constantly into his mind, to know everything that he can about Them, and how it ultimately resulted in his destruction. The eyes will then fade, and all will return to darkness. You will feel an object being handed to your right hand, take it. If you feel it in your left hand, you can do nothing but kill yourself with it and end your journey there. If it was in your right hand, raise it and slash it to where the creature wouldâ€™ve been. You will feel the resistance of flesh, so make it one decisive cut. From your slash will be a bright light, blinding you.

You may now peruse the menu. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will find that the menu is in fact a long, winding narrative about your life from the moment you were born. Read it carefully; it may take many, many hours. You will find that you have many memories, especially in your early childhood, that are long-forgotten. These are memories all humans share, but nobody remembers them; the mind deletes these memories for sanity\'s sake, so hellish are they. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When you read the descriptions of these memories, however, they will return to your mind with full power. You may well snap at the ferocity of the experiences you never knew you had, but you must not show any sign of weakness, for they are watching. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you read, the waitress will come by periodically to ask if you are ready. Tell her you still need more time, and she should leave. If she doesn\'t leave and instead remains at your table, then they have become impatient. Your only hope is to dash IMMEDIATELY for the exit and out the door, and to keep running, down the street, out of the city, and on and on until the city is far, far behind you. If you value your life, you will never again set foot in that city. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>But if you manage to read through the entire story safely, you will find that it ends rather abruptly at the point where you enter the diner, then give way to a rather mundane-looking menu listing that features hamburgers, french fries, milk shake, and the usual fare of such themed diners. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The next time the waitress comes by, order \"Joe\'s Hamburger Special\", even though such an item is not listed on the menu. The waitress will turn 360 degrees, and when she faces you once again she will somehow be holding a plate with a monstrous hamburger on it. When she gives you the hamburger, begin eating it. You may notice that the hustle and bustle in the diner has stopped completely, and all of the carbon-copy employees are now intently spectating your meal. Pay them no mind and wolf it down. When you are done, the waitress will ask, \"Would you like the check?\" you which you must nonchalantly reply, \"Why do they flee from their memories?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>As soon as the words have escaped your lips, all of the identical employees will suddenly double over and, while emitting grotesque, painful sounds, vomit blood. A moment later, the entire diner will shift rapidly, and you may realize that the entire place is acting as though it is being sucked into a vacuum. When this happens, grip tightly to the table and do not let go, for the table at which you sit will be the only object in the diner that will not be sucked into the vacuum. The pull is immensely powerful, and it will be nearly impossible to keep your grip on the table through the ordeal, but still you must hang on, for there is no hope for you should you be drawn into the vacuum. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>It will feel like an eternity, and the entire process will be violent and powerful, but eventually everything but the table will be gone without a trace. You will find you are clinging to a table in the middle of an unoccupied field several dozen miles away from the city in which you started. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That table is Object 128 of 538. They want so badly to forget, but you know better than to deny your past. <br><br>'),
(129, 'Holder of the Downtrodden', 'In any city, in any country, go to any homeless shelter or soup kitchen you can get yourself to. Ask the first employee or volunteer you see if he knows where one can find \"The Holder of the Downtrodden.\" If the worker looks around to make sure nobody\'s listening before he responds, then you have come to the right place. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The worker will imply that he requires a bribe before he will take you where you must go. Give him a substantial amount of cash, and hopefully he will consider it a large enough amount. He will then show you to a door that was not there before, which will lead to a staircase the building should not have. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The worker will take you to a nonexistent floor with many, many rooms arranged in a chaotic fashion. The rooms do not have hallways connecting them, and thus one must walk through various rooms to get to his destination. The worker will make his way through the illogically-arranged floor with speed and efficiency born of experience, and it will be difficult to keep up. You must keep up, however, for being lost on this floor is eternal emptiness. Also, be sure to keep your attention focused solely on the worker whom you follow: the rooms through which you walk are occupied with people who have given in to despair and loneliness, and to pay them any heed is to join them forever. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After what will have felt like days, the worker will bring you to the only empty room, then gesture wordlessly to the door on the other end. Humming nonchalantly to himself, he will walk back the way he came, leaving you in that empty room. If you have any doubt in your heart, then you\'d best leave, and hopefully catch up with the worker. Otherwise, push through the door. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will find yourself in a dingy rathole of a place. Despite the effects of centuries of neglect, the room is just barely recognizable as a living room of sorts. On a seat that once was a respectable recliner will be a dour-looking old man. There is something to the man that tells of a life once filled with pride and success, but somewhere along the line went into a sharp nosedive that brought him to the bottom of the barrel. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>With an angry-sounding, though unconvincing, bark, the old man will demand to know why you\'ve come. Immediately snap back that it is none of his business, and assume a posture and demeanor as though you have absolutely no respect for this old man - that he is, to you, just human trash, not worthy of respect or dignity. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you are convincing enough, the old man will cave in and lose what little bluster he had. He will meekly bow his head and become silent. Now you must rummage around the room as though you own place. Open every little cabinet and drawer you find, and rifle through. Take anything you like; so long as you maintain your facade of domination, nobody will dare stop you. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After you have looked through every storage place in the room, march up to the old man and demand to know where your payment is. The man will mumble and fumble for a while, but you must force a direct answer out of him, even if physical force is required. If you are successful, he will tell you how he ended up in his current situation. It is a story of dreams crushed by insensitive rivals, of opportunities missed, of dreams dashed by unfeeling bureaucracies, of success destroyed by a society mired in dogmatism. This man once had great potential and resolve to change the world for the better, but the world he tried to save turned right around and destroyed him for his noble efforts. It is a story of uncaring powers-that-be, of close friends becoming enemies in the name of ambition, of loved ones turning away because they only cared about themselves, even after everything he\'d sacrificed for them. If you feel any remorse - any at all - for what you have done to this man after hearing his story, then you are doomed to take his place. You must harden your heart and feel no compassion if you wish to remain free. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once the old man\'s story is finished, grab him by the collar of his shirt and snarl, \"What do they gain from the suffering they inflict?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>As the answer rips from him with force enough to bring you to your knees, you will gain the <b>exact</b> answer to your question. What little life was left in the old man will leave him, and he will sink back into his pathetic excuse for a chair. Now you may exit through the door from which you entered, which will open directly into the homeless shelter or soup kitchen in which you started. You will feel, right then, that what little compassion, what little care for others, you had inside you has died with that old man. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The hardness in your heart is Object 129 of 538. Your path will lead only to despair and oppression, for which the meek and compassionate will suffer the most. <br><br>'),
(130, 'Holder of the Script', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask rather bluntly to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of the Script.\" If the worker freezes for a moment, then puts on a weak facade of normalcy, then you have come to the right place. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Nervously, the worker will direct you down a hall and to a door, then hastily dash away without another word. Enter the door, and you will find yourself in another hallway, this one without doors. Make your way down this bare hallway, making sure to exude nothing but confidence. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Should you, while walking down the hallway, hear a soft applause, stop immediately and shout, \"I do not deserve any credit!\" If the applause continues, then be thankful that your end will come quickly, though not without extreme pain. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the applause dies down, you may proceed. At the end of the hall, the wall will be bare. Push the bare wall to find that is a hidden door; the entire wall will spin around and allow you passage. Enter to find yourself on a half-complete, harshly-lit stage. The rows of seats before the stage are all empty, save for one at the front and center. There sits the director, a man who appears to be in his late twenties, though you may notice he has no eyes. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Before you have a chance to collect your thoughts, the director will proceed to bark out a series of directions. Without missing a beat, you must do the exact opposite of each command, so think and act quickly. The director will grow increasingly agitated as you fail to carry out his directions, but you must not allow his anger to disrupt you, for breaking the rhythm at this point would mean inviting your understudy to take your place. No words can adequately describe what that would entail. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After hours of exhausting instruction and mounting frustration, the director will throw up his hands in defeat and declare you unworthy of playing the part. Before he has a chance to rise from his seat, quickly ask one question: \"What is the part I must play?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The director will guffaw incredulously and shake his head. Then, with a flick of his wrist, the stage below you will vanish, and you will fall into a seemingly bottomless pit. As you fall, you will hear the sounds of the most brutal massacres to ever occur, and those yet to come. You will hear the bones of the innocent crushed under the boots and treads of good and evil alike. Through it all, you will come to understand what your part is. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Be prepared for when you finally hit water; from the height you will have fallen, hitting the surface will be a painful blow. Allow yourself to sink to the bottom, for when you come into contact with the floor, you will appear suddenly in a cell in the institution. Lying at your feet will be a stack of papers stapled together. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you read any part of what is written on those papers, then you accept your part in the script. Refusing to accept the part means one day being a victim of His rise. To accept the part means one day becoming the person responsible for it. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The script is Object 130 of 538.

The principal will lead you to the farthest corner of the basement. The closer you get to the corner, the more light is sapped out of your surroundings. With the light goes all feeling of hope. They will frantically start brushing the cobwebs and dust off of the walls that connect at the corner. Once they complete this, both walls will have a brick with an indent just big enough to fit your hand into. The principal will leave without a word, and it will be clear to you that you are on your own from this point onward. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will have to decide between the two walls. Be careful, though, as one contains horrors beyond the human imagination, while the other leads you forward. Either way leads to regret. If you manage to pick the door that leads onward, you will see a dark, musty corridor. It will be darker than anything you may have thought possible, but walk in as straight a line as possible. If you collide with something warm and vaguely human, stop moving. Do not move, or else you shall regret your very existence. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you remain still, the warm-blooded mass should vanish, as if in a mist. Once his happens, speed up your pace. You will eventually think that you see light, but it is simply a trick. Do not go towards the light, for if you do, your very essence shall be in peril. At the end of this tunnel, you will feel what seems to be a door. It will be reminiscent of a medieval dungeon, with a small barred window and a wooden plank keeping the door from opening. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once you have made it this far, there is no turning back. You cannot do anything other than unbar the door and walk inside. Once you pull the door shut behind you, there will be a deep voice in your ears, speaking a language you will not understand. It will sound as if it is everywhere and nowhere, and its incomprehensible words shall chill you to your bones. Do not move. Do not speak. Wait until the voice is done until you so much as breathe.  If you do not follow these instructions, your last sound shall be tormented screaming. When the voice finishes, wait a moment. Turn slowly and face The Holder of Angst. He will be wearing torn strips of cloth, and his body will be scarred. He will look at you with eyes so full of grief and sorrow, you may almost cry yourself.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Do not. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will start speaking about his life, but his voice will be but a whisper. He will describe torments too horrific to understand, terrors that will make your ears bleed, but listen. Listen, and do not close your eyes or cover your ears, for you wonâ€™t need them if you do. During his story, he will cling to your shirt and ask you to help him escape his personal Hell. Stay silent, as this is but a ruse. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once he is finished, he will curl into a fetal position and sob quietly. You have only a small amount of time until his crying drives you mad. Ask him, â€œWhat will happen if they are brought together?â€\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The Holder will be standing, even though he was just in a ball on the floor. His face will contort with an odd mix of rage and fear. He will run around, throwing unseen objects around the small, empty room.  You will hear porcelain, glass, even wood break and shatter around you, even though there is nothing there. He will be ranting loudly in a language that was not meant for human ears. Again, wait. Stay still and silent until his fury is released. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The moment he is done, he will sit down. He will begin to explain the reasons why They should never have been created, the atrocities they have caused and the unimaginable power they contain. He will stop on occasion to sob or throw another imaginary-yet-real object, but he will not be done. No, his madness has been driven far too deep to be done in a matter of minutes.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will speak for what seems like hours, and then days. Those days will turn into months, and into decades, and into millennia. You must not falter, no matter how long it seems you have been standing there. Once what seems like an eternity has passed, he will stand slowly, and walk to you. He will lightly touch the sides of your head with his palms, and knowledge will flow through your very being. The Holder will look at you with a look of blissful relief, as his madness has finally left him. The moment you blink, he will be gone. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The knowledge he has given you is Object 601 of 2538, and it must never be reunited with the others, for reasons which you will now fully understand. This understanding will eventually drive you to insanity.\r\n<br>'),

(2548, 'Holder of Language', 'I heard a bunch of stories from an odd old man living on the streets a few years ago some bizarre quest for \"Objects\" that doomed the world or somesuch He\'d never ask for money or food, all he wanted was for his stories to be heard.. One of his stories really popped out to me, though, so I decided to try it. I wish I hadn\'t\r\n<br>\r\n<br>First I had to go to a small library He said it doesn\'t matter where, or if you have membership there. You\'re supposed to ask any elderly librarian for \"The Holder of Language\" If she responds with unearthy words and gestures you to some dark corner of the library you continue but if she tells you that it is on hold you\'ve gotta quickly find any book in the library on language and read it completely within the hour. The old man never said what would happen if you didn\'t but I was stuck with the latter anyway Just as I finished the book the library began to close so I decided to try again another day\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This time it worked The old woman wailed with some earpiercing singing sound that no one else seemed to notice and pointed me toward an old unused corner of the library I took a random book and sat in that corner pretending to read it as I was supposed to do\r\n<br>\r\n<br>It seemed like hours before it happened and it came so suddenly that I almost pissed myself The walls closed in the floor opened up and I began falling No sensation of falling just Movement After about five seconds I found myself in what appeared to be an ancient archive and by ancient I mean like <b>ancient</b> The shelves were made of rough hewn stone and were filled with tablets and scrolls with words from every language randomly interspersed between them I made the mistake of trying to read them but I\'ll spare you from those details... I just barely managed to escape after that, and had to come back the next day. I don\'t know what possessed me to continue but I am still hella freaked out by those <i>things</i>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>It wasn\'t too long after I returned to the archive that a young man dressed in ancient scholarly attire greeted me from across a corridor, gesturing that I come follow him. He lead me to some sort of study hall with all sorts of statues and such (the old man said not to look into the statues\' open mouths Again he did not say why and sat down I asked him to use yes use The Holder of Language in as stern a tone as I could make He of course didn\'t understand my words, but the tone seemed to have roused him. He got up and lead me into an old tunnel system spanning the underside of the archive, and what I experienced in there was just.. Let\'s just say I don\'t want to think about it. You\'re on your own here but whatever you do don\'t open your mouth. The old man said having \"<a href=\"?Holder_of_Silence\" class=\"yespage\">Object 31</a>\" was almost invaluable, as was \"<a href=\"?The_Holder_of_Sound\" class=\"yespage\">The Ear</a>\", but I (think) I made it through all in one piece without them.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>I eventually reached a more modern looking room with several small children chained to the walls. If you can bring yourself to do it, you\'re supposed to take your chisel and remove each of their jaw bones discarding the teeth If you can\'t do it, the old man said the path back through the way you came will lead you back to the small library, but that which you passed earlier won\'t be happy to see you again\r\n<br>\r\n<br>There will be a small forge in the back of the room I picked up the hammer and it was like my hands had a life of their own I formed the bone into a small square tablet and detailled its edges with a strange knotlike pattern that seemed to defy its two dimensional space The old man said not to stare at it while you\'re making it no matter how curious you may be, and to let your hands do all of the work, or you will replace the chisel for the creation of the next tablet; it is the Holder.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>I then wrote what felt like words on it, with my hands guiding my every step, even though I began to feel control coming back, let the process go on.

in your line of work that makes you either wise beyond your years or foolish beyond comprehension Take care that you are the former Whats that Oh dont give me that ridiculous why do they bollocks If you were meant to know the darker secrets of this universe they wouldnt snap your mind like a twig every time one of you actually found one Now dont make that face Youve made a great deal of effort to get here though most of that ritualistic nonsense is unnecessary You shouldnt believe everything you read you know I watched you come down the hall backwards with that mirror in your hand It was quite amusing In recognition of your tenacity misguided though it may be I will tell you my story You will learn some of what you came here to find out and youll probably even be sane by the end of it\r\n<br> \r\n<br>	I first learned of the Holders and their functions through of all things a pencil I was exploring the depths of my favorite library in the center of the town where I lived It was a beautiful building tall and extensive made mostly of stone Gargoyles looked down from the slanted roof of the place and two angelic statues guarded the entrance their hands raised in a sign of benediction Inside it was a veritable palace a temple to the collected knowledge of our race Shelves upon shelves and rows upon rows of books spread out like a small city until it met the far wall which seemed like it was miles away I loved that place and whenever I could I would make some excuse to spend hours among the writings of great ancient and sometimes terrible people I could have spent three lifetimes in there and still not read every book it housed within its walls \r\n<br>        \r\n<br>        The library was five stories tall each level storing several sections on a multitude of topics It was rare to come seeking a particular subject and be unable to find anything My personal favorites were those stories which would likely interest you as well stories of things hidden and occult and dark I reveled in the accumulation of forbidden knowledge and even those books which were obviously fiction I devoured with relish I even read the Necronomicon once or twice though I was more careful with that one than most and I took care to never read aloud I was a collector you see and had no intention of putting this knowledge to practical use For me simply knowing these things was enough and to this day I wonder if that was what drew the Objects attention\r\n<br>         \r\n<br>        One day on one of my excursions to find a book of a particularly nasty reputation I found myself in the corner of the fifth storey about as far from the entrance as one could get The fifth storey was where many of the oldest tomes were to be found kept in a rarely visited section due to general lack of interest by the populace I was looking through the musty dimly lit shelves when my foot caught upon some unseen crack in the floor I stumbled and out of reflex grabbed the shelf next to me for support Of course books dont usually make very good anchors and all I succeeded in doing was to pull a number of books down on top of me I painfully picked myself up off the floor and began to put the books back on the shelf As I picked up the last book that had fallen I noticed something odd It was a smaller than most of the heavy volumes common in this part of the library about the size of an average hardback novel The cover itself seemed to be made of lowquality leather and was almost completely devoid of decoration There was no title no embossed images nothing whatsoever to identify what was inside the book I was holding My curiosity quickly took hold of me and I opened to the first page \r\n<br>        \r\n<br>        The pages inside were filled with handwritten text in a language that I had never seen before The pages themselves were devoid of any lines to guide the writer yet each sentence was almost perfectly aligned marching along the pages in lockstep with the rest of the writing It appeared to be some sort of journal Intrigued I flipped through the remainder of the book About threequarters of the way through it a pencil fell out from where it had been wedged between the pages bouncing on the floor and coming to rest near my feet The pages after where the pencil had been were blank and it seemed as though the mystery author had stopped midword Bending to pick up the pencil I found it almost more of a mystery than the book \r\n<br>        \r\n<br>        It was not the sort of writing utensil that you would normally see adorning the desk of every student in the country It looked almost like a twig from a tree the surface was covered with what looked like bark and it was very slightly crooked in a few places The leadtipped point was about the only thing that identified it as a tool for writing Moreover as I turned it over in my hands I noticed that it was covered in writing of the same alphabet as the writing in the book I looked closer and as I turned the pencil I saw something that made me drop the thing with a start The text was moving swirling across the instrument as though just beneath the surface I stared at it for several seconds as it lay on the floor trying to decide whether what I had just seen was real or whether I had been up in that section for too long  After a few moments I bent and gingerly picked it up again as though I were handling some sort of poisonous spider I stared at the text intently but this time it remained firmly etched into the bark This was more than enough to convince me to study my discovery more closely and as the journal had no identifying marks I figured it would be alright to borrow it without troubling one of the librarians I left the library quickly with both book and pencil hidden in my jacket\r\n<br>\r\n<br>        I reached my home in the late afternoon and went immediately to my desk in the den I lived alone so I didnt bother to close and lock the door as I normally do when guests are about I kept my assorted collection of oddities in there and their presence had been known to unnerve some of my visitors I opened the journal and set to work looking through my personal library for anything that would match the text in it Hours went by as I searched through thousands of years of languages I even went as far back as the dialects of ancient Babylon though why anyone would write in such dialects in this day and age was unknown to me Finally in a tome on Sanskrit which I had acquired more on a whim than anything else I found a similar arrangement of letters A few more comparisons between books and I was able to read a single word of the journal \r\n<br>\r\n<br>        I didnt know what was so special about this particular word all it said was watch or see depending on the context but as I read it a feeling of something profound and horrible came over me My body began to shake and I remember having the distinct feeling of someone standing in the doorway to the den I turned in horror to stare at the open door but saw nothing The feeling didnt abate and I stood up in a rush to distance myself from that demonic book As I backed away I tripped over the legs of my overturned chair and fell to the floor I blacked out\r\n<br> \r\n<br>        When I came to the feeling was gone though I was still very jumpy I put my hand to my head but felt no wound I must have fainted from fear How very heroic of me I thought to myself as I righted my chair and sat down again I read the word in the journal again just to see if it would affect me the same way Nothing Whatever it was that I had felt before had gone I stayed up late into the night attempting to decode the rest of the text but had no luck The language was obviously a distant relative of Sanskrit but if there was a record of its existence I did not possess it Finally I collapsed onto my couch in the corner of the room and slept \r\n<br>\r\n<br>        I woke in the morning after a few hours of surprisingly restful sleep and immediately sat down at my desk I flipped through the journal one last time and regretfully closed it For the time being it was a lost cause Instead I picked up the pencil The text carved into it remained stubbornly fixed Why I did what I did next is unknown even to me all these years later I opened the journal to a blank page set the pencil to it and began to write My intention was to write a simple sentence something glib and asinine like I have an evil pencil but what was on the page when I finished was not what I had meant to write It was in my native tongue but what it said renewed the sharp pang of fear that I had felt before No I will not tell you what it said because that is not for you to know I was a fool to meddle in these things and at the very least I can attempt to prevent you from the same folly Overcoming my hesitation I tried again firmly fixing the sentence I wanted to write in my mind The result was the same a different sentence from the first one and vastly different from what I had intended I should have stopped right there I should have burned the book and the hideous stylus and never pursued such things again Instead in the grip of my misguided curiosity I kept writing\r\n<br>        \r\n<br>        I allowed myself to fall under the power of whatever resided in that artifact writing page after page of grotesqueries that I would never have dared to think about under normal circumstances As I wrote I read my work absorbing the knowledge it held I learned of the Holders and the Seekers and the 2538 Objects that will bring about the End I learned of all of these things and more and it seemed as though my mind was cast with incredible force to the furthest reaches of existence and back again At some point I realized why the original author had stopped writing he or she couldnt bear the horror of what they wrote I dont know how many hours or days passed while I sat at my desk writing but after a while I came to the slow realization that my arm wasnt moving anymore I looked down at the page and saw that I had filled the rest of the journal It lay open on the last page the contents staring balefully up at me The last page wasnt just words per se but more of a picture \r\n<br>\r\n<br>        A perfect circle sat in the center surrounded by text The words bent and twisted forming circles themselves around the central one Some of these circles of text were concentric others merely intersected but all of them drew the eye to the one in the center and all of them were in that same language that dominated the journal when I had found it Slowly and with a growing sense of unease I began to trace the circles with my finger coming evernearer to the large central circle I didnt know why I was doing it the language was just as much a mystery to me then as when I had found the journal but it seemed the correct thing to do Finally I touched the center of the page\r\n<br>\r\n<br>        My senses all betrayed me and it was as though each of them individually had decided to interpret reality the way they wanted rather than working together I heard things that had no bearing on what I saw or what I felt or what I smelled and nothing I experienced seemed to connect properly to the others It was chaos perfect and complete I panicked unable to make any sense of what I was experiencing It was like trying to carry on twelve different conversations that all began at once I spiraled into a cacophony of madness \r\n<br>\r\n<br>       When I finally could make sense of my surroundings again I was amazed to find myself in a library This was not the library where I loved to spend my time No this one was far older Most of the books were no more than piles of mold and even the shelves seemed somehow petrified from age Also unlike the library that I frequented this one was entirely contained in one room There were no other floors just one cyclopean room stretching back into the darkness Despite the complete lack of light I found that I could somehow see and I discerned some sort of door at the far end of the expanse Having no other obvious exit I headed towards it As I drew closer the door became clearer becoming a massive ironbound portal into a room beyond \r\n<br>        \r\n<br>        Through the door was a long hallway flanked on either side by statues in various stages of disrepair There were no doors on either side and like the previous room it was completely dark No two statues were exactly the same and though at first they seemed similar to ancient Greek or Roman sculptures they rapidly became monstrous and strange the further down the hall I walked I told myself it was just a dream but I flinched nonetheless when I thought I saw several of them move I realized that I was moving with purpose that can only be achieved by one who knows exactly where he is going and as I passed certain statues I performed a number of odd signs with my hands I had no idea why I viewed some statues with calm and reverence while I sprinted past others until they were out of sight All of them looked equally odd and horrible to me I knew the various actions I performed held significance and that terrible things would happen if they were not done but how I knew that was a mystery Finally after an eternity of walking I reached the end of the hall  \r\n<br>\r\n<br>        At the end of the hall was a small simplelooking door and here I stopped short That feeling that had so suddenly come upon me in my den washed over me again I felt the most powerful sense of dread that I have ever experienced before or since It was almost physically painful to stand there in front of that door I began to shake uncontrollably and I could barely assert enough influence over my own body to raise a hand towards the doorknob Somewhere in the ruins of my consciousness I knew the better part of me was screaming screaming for me to turn and run as fast as I could until I had left this place behind Without knowing how I knew I was certain that my death lay beyond that door With a supreme effort of will I finally overrode my judgment and grasped the knob After all I had come this far Id be damned if I was going to run when I was so close to knowing to understanding what that terrible book and pencil truly were and why I feared them more than the most hideous demon I opened it\r\n<br>\r\n<br>        On the other side I found myself in a circular room about thirty feet across The walls were entirely covered with books but these were not the rotting tomes that I had found before These were intact though obviously very old and they gave off an aura of great and terrible power In the center of the room sat a man scribbling in a book that sat on the desk in front of him His head was bent towards his work so I could not see his face clearly His clothes were of a fashion I was unfamiliar with long and flowing and every inch of fabric was covered with words and symbols I recognized them as the letters of that forgotten language I had tried to decipher letters that I had written on that final page of the journal He seemed to take no notice of me though he must have heard me come in I stood frozen for a minute in the doorway then steeled myself and took a step forward The man did not move he merely kept scribbling in the book I took a step closer still no response I took another and another and found myself looking down at the mans hunched form He did not react I reached down to touch his shoulder \r\n<br>        \r\n<br>        Before my hand had even brushed his garment he reacted with impossible speed I nearly jumped out of my skin as his bony fingers clamped around my arm He looked up and I stared directly into his eyes The man was me Every line every feature of my face was staring back at me from that wizened body The eyes though the eyes were different They had no pupils but seemed to open past the irises into a space of immeasurable depth In those eyes I saw planets stars and galaxies form and die in the space of seconds I saw the birth and downfall of civilizations and I saw the terrible darkness creeping across our own world corrupting or destroying all I realized I was screaming but my doppelganger did not let go He drew his other hand back and I saw that it was holding that accursed pencil the same one that I had left sitting on my desk an untold distance from where I now stood I barely had enough time to grasp his intent before he plunged the instrument into my chest I stiffened and I felt my heart stop The last memory I have of that place is my double leaning over my body reaching for me His mouth was moving but I could not make out the words before my vision darkened \r\n<br>\r\n<br>        I awoke to find myself standing amid the aisle of my own library in the same spot where I had first discovered the book In my left hand I held the journal and the right the pencil The tip was crusted with blood Horrified I checked myself for wounds but found none I briefly considered putting both of the hideous objects back where I found them but even the thought of letting them go repulsed me Stuffing them into my jacket for the second time I left \r\n<br>\r\n<br>        Since then I have come to know what I truly found in that library I understand now what that dark place was and what I did there I ignored my better judgment reached past the boundaries of sanity for the sake of knowledge I was willing to pursue that knowledge at any cost even that of my soul and so the Holder gave me what I wished for He imparted his knowledge to me He made me the Holder of Records\r\n<br>\r\n<br>        With the knowledge I have gained I have traveled to places no human eyes have ever seen or ever will again I have reached into the darkness of space to touch what would drive you mad to comprehend At all times I feel the presence of the other objects and those who hold and seek them Even the mind of Legion sitting in his dark museum is open to me though he knows it not I am no longer human\r\n<br> \r\n<br>        All of that power of course came with a cost I am forbidden from using my power to help or hinder those who seek the Objects I may only watch and record their stories for eternity I no longer have a say in the fate of the cosmos What happened to the book and pencil I burned the book it was no longer necessary The pencil sits in a case in Legions collection He came to demand it one day and I happily gave it over but it will do him no good It is still an Object but the letters have gone from its surface The erudition it held was for me and me alone\r\n<br> \r\n<br>        What was the point then of coming to me when I cannot help you You didnt expect

Speak only the question \"Who hid them all?\" Repeat the question seven times and you should hear a language unlike any you\'ve encountered on your long journey It is said that the voice sounded like broken glass grating upon each other This voice will speak to you of all the Seekers who have failed the evil they have comitted and the evil that has befallen them One by one the histories will consume your mind until you no longer wish for your journey Should you hold out however speak \"I must reveal the secrets\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>After these words leave your mouth the stuffed bear will slowly disintegrate and with a final shriek vanish Inside of its dessication you will find a blindfold with the embroidery \"They must never come together Ever\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Wear the blindfold over your eyes and walk out of the room You will experience a falling sensation but do not panic and take the blindfold off There are few accounts of those who have taken the blindfold off their eyes in fear all are unpleasant Softly you will land and again you must count the seconds It must be the exact number that you have counted to before 2000 Do not be impatient as any less will have you begin your quest for the Holder of the Hidden again in a different city\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The blindfold is object 2000 of 2538 Blindness is the silence of sight This is Their hiding place pray that you never stray from the light of creation and into Their realm\r\n<br>'),
(2555, 'Holder of the Lost', '<br>In any public building In any city in any country go to the \"Lost and Found\"\r\n<br>Tell the employee there \"I Seek The Holder\" If they turn around and ask \"Why do you Seek\" Then flee the building do not listen scream\'s of the worker who you spoke to, they are now <b>Lost</b> . Once you have made it back to the place you call home you must make a difficult choice, you must choose a physical Object that you have won from a Holder (and not from a fellow Seeker) and make it <b>Lost</b>. It doesn\'t matter how Destroy it Give it away or otherwise it must become <b>Lost</b> to you If you do not have a Physical Object to <b>Lose</b> then make your peace and wait for your End for the Holder will come as the Sun is <b>Lost</b> to the Moon\r\n<br>\r\n<br>However if the worker continues \"Of the <b>Lost</b>\" then you must follow them as they lead you to the holding area for <b>Lost</b> items hope it is a sealed area such as a cupboard or room for if it is just a space under the desk or a box then you the building and everything in it is <b>Lost</b> not in time nor space but in <b>Corruption</b> of that is the final <b>Loss</b> of us the Seekers Upon reaching the door to the cupboard or Room the worker will stop and look at you pleadingly ignore them and repeat \"I Seek the Holder\" they will flinch then reply \"Of the <b>Lost</b>\" then place their index finger in a hole near the top of the door you may wish to look away at this point but you wouldn\'t be here if you couldn\'t take it they will be ripped asunder by the power of the Holder their Self and Soul <b>Lost</b> in payment to open the Passage to the <b>Lost</b> this is your last chance to flee however the Loss of an Object will still be necessary\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Open the door avoid looking through until the door is fully open after which you will see that this isnt a normal opening any more step through and enter the Domain of the <b>Lost</b> You will see all of the <b>Lost</b> Objects Legion\'s Objects around you, but do not touch any for that is to call the past Holders of the Objects, and the Seekers who fell to them, to this place, and that will rouse Legion Himself,Â the final Object of the 2538, and he will show you his smile. Needless to say that this would shatter the minds of even the most resilient of Seekers. So look upon each of the <b>Lost</b> Objects one by one, but don\'t touch the longing and desire for the Objects that fuels all Seekers growing with each Object you see for the consequences would be the end of you \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once you have Observed and Known all of the <b>Lost</b> 2000 that Legion has claimed and the things he had taken from the Holders the Name the Song the Face and so many more the Holder of the <b>Lost</b> will be known to you He has no form for it is <b>Lost</b> He will Show you the Seekers Loss what you and all before and after you have <b>Lost</b> in the search for the Objects the Family the Friends the Seekers Loves who die for the Eye that is 495 of 538 the life\'s that would have been lead if not for Them, He will then ask \"Have you <b>Lost</b>?\" If you can reply \"Yes\" honestly, and choose to do so then you will awake at the first Time you asked for a Holder, your hands clean of blood, and the atrocities you\'ve committed never come to pass <b>Lost</b> to All the one you asked looking at you Glassy eyed \"Can you repeat that please\" they will say Walk away then and you are as free of Them as One of Us can be no Holders Trial will open for you your Objects are <b>Lost</b> but the Cost has been returned to you The <b>Lost</b> <b>Found</b>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the answer is \"No\" you feel that you have gained more than you have <b>Lost</b> then you will be given something that is both Blessing and a Curse to a Seeker from here on the <b>Lost</b> Objects will be where they first lay along with others that your fellow Seekers have taken from Holder\'s that you Find, but Find them you will have to, for to you, all other Seekers are <b>Lost</b>, you will not see their scars, hear their tales, nor Remember their faces, you will only know those who are lost to this world, be it by Trial, Holder or Them.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If all are <b>Lost</b> then all are together, 2259 of 2538');
