(1, 'The Holder of the End', ' In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house in you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of the End\". Should a look of child-like fear come over the workers face, you will then be taken to a cell in the building. It will be in a deep hidden section of the building. All you will hear is the sound of someone talking to themselves echo the halls. It is in a language that you will not understand, but your very soul will feel unspeakable fear. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Should the talking stop at any time, STOP and QUICKLY say aloud \"I\'m just passing through, I wish to talk.\" If you still hear silence, flee. Leave, do not stop for anything, do not go home, don\'t stay at an inn, just keep moving, and sleep where your body drops. You will know in the morning if you\'ve escaped. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the voice in the hall comes back after you utter those words continue on. Upon reaching the cell all you will see is a windowless room with a person in the corner, speaking an unknown language, and cradling something. The person will only respond to one question. \"What happens when they all come together?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The person will then stare into your eyes and answer your question in horrifying detail. Many go mad in that very cell, some disappear soon after the meeting, and a few end their lives. But most do the worst thing, and look upon the object in the person\'s hands. You will want to as well. Be warned that if you do, your death will be one of cruelty and unrelenting horror. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Your death will be in that room, by that person\'s hands. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That object is 1 of 538. They must never come together. Never.'),
(2, 'The Holder of the Beginning', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask the clerk for permission to visit someone who calls herself \"The Holder of the Beginning.\" A small smile will work its way over their mouth, almost as if to say, \"You fool.\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will then be taken down a long hallway -- long enough that you would expect it to lead outside of the building. Yet, in clear violation of the laws of space and physics, it instead leads deep into the heart of the institution. The hall will be forever silent, even if you try to make noise. Screams will die before leaving your mouth, and footsteps will be muffled. In lieu of speech, your guide will simply point to a door.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Beyond it lies a cozy room filled with a pleasant yet unidentifiable perfume. At the room\'s center, a beautiful woman holds her empty arms as if cradling something. This room will remain just as silent as the hallway that led to it, until you ask a singular question: \"Why were they separated?\" The woman will then explain, in excruciating detail, every horrific event in history. Every beating. Every war. Every rape. Every killing. No travesty in the history of the universe will escape your ears. When she finishes, all will fall silent, and you will be free to leave. It is up to you to do what you will with this information.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That woman is Object 2 of 538. It is up to you if they should be joined or not. <br><br>\r\n    The hall will be forever silent, even if you try to make noise.

(3, 'The Holder of Eternity', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Eternity\". A sigh might escape the worker as they look upon you with the utmost pity. They will take you down a flight of stairs that you might expect to lead to the basement; they don\'t.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you press deeper and deeper into the underbelly of the institution, you will begin to hear a chorus of screams. At first it will be barely audible, as if originating from a point a great distance away, but as you approach the end of the hallway, the screams will grow clearer and more thunderous, until they drone so loudly as to consume all other noises. The din will quickly become so painful that you will feel the unrelenting urge to claw at your own ears to escape it; resist this impulse. The worker, stoically enduring the cacophony, will show you a door. As swiftly as they can, they will unlock it and run, leaving you alone in this cramped, dark hallway.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This will be your last chance to run. If you decide to continue, open the door; the piercing wail will then end abruptly, leaving your ears ringing. The room you will enter will be coated in an almost tangible darkness that consumes all but the far wall. Manacled to that wall is an emaciated figure covered in raw lashes. He will stare directly at you with a maniacal grin plastered to his face, seemingly undisturbed by his festering wounds and the scalpel rammed into his chest. The only way to save yourself from this man\'s dark designs is to ask, \"Who created them?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will cackle in a manner befitting the death throes of an animal, before responding. His will be the most horrific tale you have ever heard, beyond such primitive concepts as pain and death. It will delve deep into the very essence of evil; those of weak mind would go mad hearing it.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>When he finishes, it will be up to you to release this man from his terrible burden. Remove the scalpel and he will shudder once in agony before falling silent... forever.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That scalpel is Object 3 of 538. It is up to you if the rest should be protected or destroyed. <br><br>'),
(4, 'The Holder of Nothing', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls herself \"The Holder of Nothing.\" Should a look of sheer, primal disgust mar the worker\'s expression, you will then be taken to a separate building, one that appears to be an old, wooden outhouse. Inside will be a seemingly endless corridor that far exceeds the length of that outhouse.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The corridor will be completely silent. Attempting to make any sound at the wrong time is a grievous, lamentable mistake. You will notice the lights in the corridor getting brighter and brighter as you make your way down towards the end; eventually, you will find yourself blinded by their brilliance. If, at any point the lights go out, quickly shout out, \"No! Stop! What you are doing is wrong!\" while backing away. If the lights do not come back on, bolt for the door you came in through. It should still be open; hopefully you aren\'t far enough down the hallway for it to close on you. If it does close, an eternity in Hell would be preferable to what you will suffer.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the lights come back on, continue walking down the corridor. At the end of the hall lies a cell; the worker will open its door for you while glaring at you in disgust. Inside the cell will be a mad pastiche of colors, arranged in several harlequin-like formations. You must not be distracted by them, for at the center of the room is a naked young woman, slathered in blood and bound by strips of human sinew, and you would be better off not knowing what will happen if you take your eyes off of her face for even a moment. Focus on her, and ask: \"What were they when they were one?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>She will look you in the eye and speak the answer in incredible detail. It will be unlike anything you have ever heard, leaving you on the verge of both ecstasy and agony. It is not uncommon for a Seeker to lose themselves in the euphoria. But you mustn\'t let your focus break, and you must take special care not to look upon her tattooed chest. Your mind will tempt you to gaze upon it, but you must resist, for if you fail, she will flay you alive and add your mutilated flesh to her bindings, and you will remain trapped with her, fully conscious, for the rest of time.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That tattoo is Object 4 of 538. They desire to be one again, but they mustn\'t.  <br><br>'),
(5, 'The Holder of Light', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, close your eyes and ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Light\". You will be led to a single door leading to a long, winding hallway, and then told to open your eyes. Open the door. The hallway beyond it will be pitch black, but narrow enough for you to feel the walls with outstretched arms, and guide yourself forward.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If, at any point during your trek down the hall, it is suddenly bathed in light, shut your eyes immediately and quickly make your way back to the door you came in through. If your eyes stay open for more than a second, what you see will force you to instinctively tear them out.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If, on the other hand, the lights stay off long enough for you to navigate the entire corridor, you will reach another door. Look down: if you can see any light escaping from the crack beneath the door, flee immediately, for what you seek is not there. If no light escapes the next room, then carefully turn the doorknob and enter.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The room beyond will be completely dark, aside from a single, dimly-lit candle at its center. The faint light it emits will reveal the outline of a cloaked, motionless figure huddled over it. There is only one question that he will respond to: â€œWhat can protect us from Them?â€ Say anything else, and the man will tear out your eyes, and force you to take his place under the cloak for the rest of eternity.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you ask the proper question, a piercing scream will ring out from the candle, and a series of lights will illuminate the room, revealing images of the most horrifying thoughts, fantasies and memories experienced by sentient minds throughout history. Most people cannot handle this event, turning violently insane or perishing instantly at the sight of such horrors. If you should somehow manage to survive the ordeal, the cloaked man will rise slowly and put his hands to your head, turning your gaze to meet his youthful face.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Stare directly into his empty, gaping eye sockets, for if you look away from that terrible sight, you will be stranded in this room, forever forgotten by time itself. Do not turn to look as he opens your right hand, and places a small, round object upon your palm. As that object touches your hand, you will find yourself able to ignore even the most fearsome agonies -- unless you are in the process of obtaining another Object, for the pains you feel then are far beyond any worldly suffering. Know that even this newfound power will never help you cope with the the horrifying images you have witnessed in that room. They will be burned into your memory for all eternity. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The eye you hold in your hand is Object 5 of 538. The awakening has begun; they must not be brought together. <br><br>'),
(6, 'The Holder of Song', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls herself \"The Holder of Song.â€ You will then be guided to a long staircase that spirals higher than the building stands. At the stairs\' summit is a door.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you open the door, a sudden wave of heat will pour out from the hallway beyond it, and wash over you. Proceed down the hallway. As you walk, the air around you will grow increasingly frigid. When you feel as if you are encased in ice, you must stand perfectly still, remain silent, and listen. If, after a few seconds pass, you hear a baby crying, turn and run. No harm will befall you, but the infant\'s cry will follow you wherever you go. If you hear it for the rest of your life, count yourself lucky; if and when it stops, your firstborn child will die.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you do not hear a baby\'s cry, wait for the hallway to grow warm once more, and then proceed to the door at its end. Enter.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The room beyond will be awash in green light. At its center will be an old woman turning the handle of a silent music box. Her legs have both been severed at the knees. When you speak to her, you must look her in the eyes. She hides a spear fashioned from the bones of her legs; break eye contact, and she will impale you with it and leave you to bleed to death in seemingly unending agony. She will respond to only one question: \"What was the song they used to play?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The old woman will begin to sing in a language not of this world. Her melody will be the most beautiful one you have ever heard, bringing peace and serenity to your mind, body, and soul. You will find yourself vividly imagining a band of carefree children playing and singing, innocent as can be... And within minutes, the scene will eventually take a horribly sinister turn. The children will begin to fight each other, and their conflict will quickly escalate to the most brutal, lethal violence you can conceive of. They will impale each other on wooden poles, disembowel each other with sharp rocks, and even rip flesh from bone with their bare hands. You will witness these children, now merely tattered doppelgangers of themselves, spreading death and destruction more horrific than you could ever imagine on your own. You will see a naked boy, drenched in blood, singing with delight as he runs through a hellish wasteland, pursued by unspeakable monsters. They will overtake him and utterly destroy him, the song still issuing forth from his shredded lips all the while.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>...Yet, inexplicably, you will remain calm and peaceful even as you watch this unspeakable brutality.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>When these horrific visions end, an intense pain will stab at your chest. Your heart will feel like it is about to explode. Do not let the agony break your focus, and do not break eye contact with the old woman, lest you invite a fate so horrible that an exploding heart seems lovely by comparison. If you remain steadfast in your gaze, the pain will eventually cease. The woman will stand up (though, with your eyes still focused on hers, you will know not how) and place the music box in your hands.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The music box is Object 6 of 538. When its song plays again, they will all come together. <br><br>'),
(7, 'The Holder of the Path', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of the Path.\" The worker there will try his best to keep a look of indifference on his face while handing you a key which, as he will explain, belongs to an unused supply closet in the building. If only it were that simple. Upon locating and unlocking the correct door, you will find yourself staring out onto a narrow, winding road suspended in an endless void, the sight only occasionally obstructed by the massive outlines of things best left undescribed.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>To fall off the path is to be thrown out of reality itself. A nightmarish eternity of inconceivable horror awaits anyone who either stumbles into the void by their own error, or is dragged off the path by the timeless monstrosities that reside on the outskirts of creation. If you should ever feel as if you are being watched while traveling through this piece of oblivion, the best chance you have is to immediately freeze in place and hold your breath. Continue to do so until your audience either loses interest, or moves in to claim you. If the latter should occur, feel free to scream as hard as you want, though your screams will fall on deaf ears.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>At the end of the path lies a door that leads to a small, dirt-caked room. Propped up against the room\'s far wall is a heavily emaciated corpse; what\'s left of its skin has long since blackened with necrosis. Approach it and ask one question: \"How did they acquire guardians?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>In response to your query, the \"corpse\" will begin to stir. A subtle red glow will emanate from its eye sockets as it lifts its head and begins to whisper the long and macabre history of the Holders. It will speak of unholy pacts and unspeakable atrocities. Within time, its tale will touch upon every form of evil known to man or God, and a few forms that neither can comprehend. Furthermore, if told the title of any Holder, the corpse will reveal that Holder\'s history and the meaning of the object that it protects. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Well, almost any Holder. The Holder of the Path will never go into detail about itself. This is because the ghoul hopes that you will not question why it seems to be lacking an Object. Truth be told, the ominous glow from within the ghoul\'s eye sockets is actually the shining light of the Object that was somehow sealed inside of its skull.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That is Object 7 of 538. Its Holder will do anything to keep you away from it. <br><br>'),
(8, 'The Holder of Wealth', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Wealth.\" The worker will raise one eyebrow, as if puzzled by your request. Ask a second time, and the worker will shrug and take you across the street, where an opulent mansion awaits. If you are observant by nature, you may notice that the mansion was not there when you started your quest... Its owner would rather you didn\'t think about such things. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Inside the front door will lie a grand staircase, spiraling up across the foyer. The walls will be covered with fine paintings, and a large marble statue will rest on a pedestal by the base of the stairs. The statue\'s eldritch features will evoke an image of a truly horrific beast, at once both alien and evil. Admire it all you want, but don\'t touch it, unless you wish to awaken this starved monster. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Ascend the staircase. As long as you don\'t touch anything, you will be safe. Don\'t panic. At the top of the stairs, you will find a small, wooden door; its plain and unassuming appearance is a sharp contrast to its decadent surroundings. It will open on its own for you, so long as you are not afraid. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Past it, you will see a man with a pointed goatee and short, cropped, gelled hair standing behind a large, mahogany desk. His suit is made of both human flesh and Italian silk. He may speak, and at great length. He will talk about his amazingly beautiful house and the lovely statue of his concubine resting downstairs. Do not interrupt him, and do not answer any questions he may ask. When he is finished, steel yourself and confidently ask, \"May I have my salary?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will proceed to explain to you, in great detail, the value of life. He will talk of things worse than death, and he will tell you exactly what he expects you to do. The fabulous interior of the room will rot away, and the floor will turn from French weave to feces. The man\'s appearance will become cyclopic and unimaginably horrendous. He will fish out a small bank note from the pockets of his human suit, and hand it to you. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That note is Object 8 of 538. Its Holder is counting on you to spend it. <br><br>'),
(9, 'The Holder of Wisdom', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Wisdom.\" The desk clerk will chuckle and guide you to an empty room. They will hand you a key and tell you to wait some time in the room until you hear a bell ring. When it rings, you have to lock the door through which you entered, wait until a second ring, and unlock it. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once those instructions have been carried out, the door will open all by itself and reveal a long hallway, with every conceivable color painted onto the walls, ceiling and floor. Follow the hallway until you hear a little girl singing.  Stop, close your eyes, and stay where you are until the girl finishes the song. If you fail to remain perfectly still, run. Run back to the door through which you came, as fast as you can. Jump through the window of the room where you waited earlier, and you might live. Should you be unable to reach the window in time, you will be dragged back into the hallway by something that is definitely not a little girl. You will be pulled by this horror until time itself ends, forever feeling the pain of every soul dragged to an early grave.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If, on the other hand, you manage to remain perfectly still until the song ceases, you will be free to either turn around and leave forever, or venture further into this realm. If you prefer the latter course of action, walk deeper into the hallway until you reach a human-shaped door. Open it with the same key that was given to you earlier, step inside, and close the door behind you. In the middle of the room, you will see a desk with a bright candle. Behind the desk is a man, whose face isn\'t visible behind the shine of the candle. Approach, but always keep the flame between you and the man\'s face, for if you witness what he looks like, your gaze will be fixed on his until your own hands have removed every inch of skin from your bones.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Stop when you are five steps away from the desk. The man will raise his hand and gesture you to come closer, but do not step any further than this. Close your eyes and ask him one question: \"Who will bring them back together?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will hear the man rise from his chair and begin to pray in a language that you will not understand. After two minutes, you will hear a name.  If you hear \"Anubis\", then you had best utter your own prayers in the short time you will have to do so... but if it is \"Thor\" you hear, then you may open your eyes.  You will see the man\'s severed head lying on his desk, still speaking.  After another three minutes, his prayer will cease, and he will tell you how you will die. He will describe every minute detail of your horrible death, and you will be unable to move or react while he explains your end. Lastly, he will describe the one who will steal your life away from you, and go into such detail as to why it is necessary that you yourself will question which would be worse: you being murdered, or you being allowed to continue to live.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Eventually, the head will finish its ghastly tale. It is object 9 of 538. It is up to you what you do with the knowledge of your death, for now, it is inevitable. <br><br>'),
(10, 'The Holder of Ambition', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit a man who calls himself the \"Holder of Ambition.\" The sound that escapes the mouth of the worker will be so slight, and betray so little reaction, that at first, you may not even be sure your words were heard. All doubt will be settled when they guide you toward a stairwell lit by many windows.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>At the top of these stairs, the worker will leave you to continue your journey alone. You will find yourself standing at the beginning of an eerily calm hallway. Walk to the end.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>In all likelihood, you will encounter a shadow that moves along the wall. Do not follow it, for it is the one thing that will lead you to a place you do not wish to go: a place filled with your silent fears and failures, from which you cannot return. No matter what shape the shadow takes, and no matter how it eases and taunts your dreams with the greatest of your desires and hopes, do not even let it tempt your gaze, let alone your feet.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you make it to the end of the hallway without losing sight of your goal, you will find an open doorway with no locks, bolts, or restraints. A soft light bathes the floor in front of the opening. This is your one and only chance to leave without facing the Holder of Ambition or collecting his Object: if that is the course of action you wish to take, then walk directly back the way you came, without attempting to peek around or into other doors, lest you discover what that seductive shadow hides.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Beyond the doorway lies a room, bathed in an artificial light cast by high windows that cover each wall\'s expanse. At the room\'s center stands a tall, healthy man, standing naked and looking out into the light. His body is covered in uncountable tattoos and scars; only his face is recognizable as unaltered human flesh. You might be tempted to look where he looks, in search of the object of his focus; feel free, but you will see nothing, and learn nothing. The man will not react to anything other than the question, \"What joins them together?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>When asked, he will turn to look you in the eyes. Meet his gaze, but know that if you are not prepared -- if there is even the slightest doubt of your intentions -- then you will lose yourself in his soulless eyes for an eternity. If, on the other hand, your gaze is an honest one, then he will begin to speak in a low voice. His tone will be a comical one, his tale told as if they meant nothing at all, but you must not miss a word, for this story is your preparation. Listen carefully to his tale, and remember every detail.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>When the man finishes speaking, he will bring his hands to his chest, and remove the sutures from one of his more noticeable scars. As the stitches come out, he will bleed profusely and fatally. When the last of his sutures have come out, he will offer them to you, uttering his final words through his own gurgling blood: \"Choosing to seek... leads to an inevitable fate...\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The clump of sutures is object 10 of 538. How you use them depends on what you hear. <br><br>'),
(11, 'The Holder of Life', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Life\". The worker will try to suppress a groan and you will have to ask again. He will then lead you to an operating room that looks just like any other you might or might not have seen in your life. The worker will give you a scalpel and then leave you alone in the room, locking the door behind him.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will have to wait. Wait for almost an hour. Then the door will open and several people will enter the room, including a pregnant woman. The woman will lie down on the operating table; the other people, who will look like doctors, will prepare everything for the child\'s birth. While they do that, you will be able to ask the woman one question. Ask \"How can they be reassembled?â€ Say nothing else, or the doctors will begin to skin and disassemble you. You will be fully conscious while they do this.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you have asked the right question, the woman will begin to scream, the child is about to be born. You will have to wait until it\'s over, and one of the doctors will give you the child, moving his mouth, but without sound coming from his lips. As soon as he finishes \'talking\' and smiles, you will have to throw the child to the ground and ram the scalpel into its head, or else it will smash your rib-cage and rip your heart out with inhuman strength.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you have thrown the child to the ground in time, it will, despite the scalpel in its head, answer the question you have asked earlier. It will speak with a demonic voice that might drive you mad. While it is talking, the other people in the room will vanish without leaving a trace. After the child finishes talking, it will simply die and the door of the room will unlock. You are now free to go, if you have not been driven mad by the voice.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The dead baby is object 11 of 538. Dare you not remove the scalpel? <br><br>'),
(12, 'The Holder of Catastrophe', 'In any city, in any country, go to any abandoned amusement park you can enter.  Find the largest roller coaster in the park, no matter its condition.  Take a seat on the far left side of the first cart, then close your eyes and whisper \"I wish to see the Holder of Catastrophe.\"  \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will feel the coaster start to move, yet you cannot open your eyes, or you will find yourself moving through an endless void which you will never escape.  The coaster will then slowly start to head up, for what seems to be ages as you listen to the rumbling of the tracks.  You will then hear voices whisper at you and ask you to save them, yet you must not respond to them, or they will take you away to the same void to which they belong.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The voices will stop speaking to you and the cart will come to a stop.  With your eyes still closed, you must grasp the bar in the cart as tightly as you possibly can, or you will be left behind forever.  After you do so, you will feel yourself plummeting straight down at impossible speeds.  The air around you will start to grow cold, and continues as it feels as if you are freezing.  As you sense the cart around you disappear, you must keep hold of the bar, as it is the only thing keeping you attached to reality.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Abruptly you will stop.  Drop the bar, and sit still with your eyes closed until you start to hear the sound of a carnival fanfare in the distance, and only than can you open your eyes, to which you will be greeted by a large pinstriped circus tent a few yards in front of you, surrounded by meadows and happy people, young and old.  You must walk towards the tent, staring at the small entrance which is shrouded by darkness.  As you continue walking, the scenery around you will start morphing.  Slowly the meadow dies, the carnival music slows and bends in pitch until it starts to sound twisted and demonic.  The people decay in the very spots they stand.  They will scream in agony, and ask you to help them, yet you cannot look directly at them, or you will meet the same fate as these illusions.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must continue forward until you finally reach the dark entrance.  Walk forward and allow yourself to be swallowed by the darkness, yet do not stop or look back, as if you do either, you will never find an exit.  Continue your walk into the void until you see a dim light in the distance, and start to hear the sobbing of a man.  Follow these two signs, as you hear the crying of the man growing louder, until you can see the light is coming from a door in the darkness.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>When you walk through the door, you will be greeted by a cold, cement cell. In the far left corner, you will see the crying man dressed as a circus clown, covering his face with a small diary.  You must slowly approach him, as not to aggravate him, until he is right by your feet.  Sit down next to him and ask, \"What do we have to lose?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The clown will then read you an excerpt from the diary through his sobs.  The writings in detail describe the demise of millions of innocents, and the forces that so cruelly and coldly carried out this act.  As he reads, illusions will appear around you, and in the side of your vision you will see every death of every person in the story, many of which were slaughtered, many of which were taken by disease.  However, you must keep looking at the clown, as if you lose sight of him, you will be stuck in this illusion and you will become part of the story yourself.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>After he is done, he will stop crying.  He will lower the book from in front of his face, revealing that he has suffered the same decay as the illusions which you had seen before.  He will hand the book to you, which you must accept.  He warns that you cannot read the diary yourself, or else you will be driven mad.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will then whisper, \"When the stakes are high, best to play the clown,\" as the rest of his body starts to decay, as well as the room around you.  You must close your eyes one more time, keeping hold of the book, and count to exactly twelve seconds before opening them.  When you do, you will find yourself in the same seat of the roller coaster in which you began.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The diary is Object 12 of 538. These events must never be allowed to occur again. <br><br>'),

Keep asking him until he stops denying and withdraws from his counter to guide you through the corridors. As his behavior changes radically, stay on guard, for if you start hearing one single tiny sinister hiss, you should turn around and flee as far as you can, covering your ears, because the time was bad. If you do not escape in time, the faint sound will turn into a dreadful growling, that will soon merge into a continuous shriek of sheer pain, until madness floods you and leaves you to die in a deafening agony.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the warden remains silent, he will lead you to a closed door with neither handles nor lock. As he pushes it open effortlessly, you will see an ascending winding staircase which canâ€™t possibly lead to any upper floor of the establishment. The door will close behind you and you will not be able to push it back. Past this point, climb and do not turn back, or you will fall into a bottomless pit waiting for living prey to chew upon. Do not count the steps, for knowing how many there are will drive you to insanity. One will then creak, and at that point you should stop. Another door should appear on your left. If it is on your right, then pray for a swift passing.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Enter slowly into the room, and a blinding, obscuring darkness shall descend upon you. You will be required to walk straight forward, for straying even slightly will lead you to be devoured by the roaming and unknown creatures observing you with blinded and purulent eyes. You will know you have arrived when coldness grips you. At that very moment, freeze, or you will die by the hands of the holder who is standing right in front of you. In complete darkness, even closing your eyes will not prevent you from his horrid appearance. It will form into your mind as the most outrageous monster ever conceived, and madness will try to creep into your brain as worms over a decayed corpse. His fulminating breath and constant mumbling would be enough to make you cry, but be advised not to utter anything louder than a weeping, for you might wake what must not be awakened. The only question you will be able to whisper without being torn apart will be \"What do they fear?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will feel movements all around you, as shudders animate your opponents. You will hear what nameless and incurable diseases will strike the world if they were to be frightened, the countless terrors their own fright will unleash on those with a weaker mind than theirs. Amidst the atrocious enumeration of the endless sores the world will suffer, you might hear the simplest, almost ridiculous, yet implacable and certain truth they all fear. Do not move again. When your head is about to implode, it will stop. If you are still able to move, you will find a door in front of you which leads you outside of the ward. There, in the open, in the grass, a broken hourglass will wait for you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You are free to pick it up. It is object 13 of 538.

(14, 'The Holder of the Adversary', 'In any city, in any country, venture across the highways and lonely roads until you reach the city\'s bottom rung. Walk among the ones society has cast away, beggars and poor picked raw by the demands of those better off. Should you come across a scruffy man under a large oak tree holding a bottle of liquor in a paper bag, his shirt sweat-stained and his pants muddied, do not be afraid to ask him if he knows of the one who calls itself \"The Holder of the Adversary\".\r\n<br>\r\n<br>More than likely, he will smile knowingly at you, like an old friend with whom you\'ve just shared an inside joke. Do not be alarmed; the man knows of the one you search for. The less fortunate of us often know things we will never dream of. He will guide you to a manhole and casually slide the metal lid off with one grimy boot. Tossing you a small flashlight which flickers precariously, he will urge you down into the darkness.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once inside the putrid womb of the sewage system, you will come to realize that it bears no unpleasant scent - no scent whatsoever, in fact. But, turning on the flashlight and gazing at your surroundings, you will notice you are in a round room. On all the walls will hang partially decomposed bodies, their owners forever suspended in a state of half-awareness, feeling all the pain and horror of a body withering and rotting around them. Corpses litter the floors, and you may notice that one nearly touches you. Do not shrink back. To show cowardice would invite no creature or entity that you would do well to know. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once you have observed your surroundings, the smell will arrive. It will be the most awful thing you could imagine: human and animal excrement, sulfur, rotting bodies, burning flesh. You will want to claw your nose from your face, and the watering of your eyes will nearly blind you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>But do not cower, do not run, and resist the urge to vomit. You will find a thought in your head, unbidden: \"We are the remains of the ones who could not face the Adversary.\" There is no source of this whisper, though it may curl around you as if carried by the stench itself. Suddenly, the bodies will rupture and burst, one by one, releasing more of the horrible stench and bathing you in rotted bodily fluids and slimy chunks of human refuse.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The corpses then will sink to the floor, and what rises from the slurry is a creature of pure beauty. Man, woman, or something else entirely - it depends on you yourself. It will not be possible to shake your gaze from this gorgeous, naked human until you realize the creature is an idealized caricature of you. Confident, heart-achingly gorgeous, smiling a gentle, patient smile, It will be everything you yourself could ever desire to become.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will be overcome by a sudden jealousy, a total anger, a need to annihilate this perfect you. Do not give in, no matter how strong the temptation. If you do, you are doomed to the Adversary\'s wrath - the eternal torment of the Damned you have witnessed prior. There is only one question you must ask the exquisite creature: \"What could they destroy?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The Holder of the Adversary will laugh at you melodically, condescendingly, and will explain to you as though you are a small, stupid child exactly the answer to your question. It will spare you no details, even the most horrific. Though horrifying, the story will be interesting and calming to listen to, and you will find yourself absorbed in a childlike fascination with The Holder. You may liken its story to one told to you by a loved one or a guide when you were a child, and you will know that you now have the key to defeating the Adversary - that which the Damned could not acquire. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>At the end of the story, The Holder will ask, smiling pleasantly, \"What will you do now, my child?\" If it asks you anything else, or tells you something different, your fate is sealed, and when you eventually emerge from the sewer, the ragged people you have encountered will descend upon you like ravenous animals, and tear you apart with tooth and nail, feeding on your body. There is no escape, only the knowledge that it <i>will</i> happen.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Regardless of your fate, The Holder will place an Object in your palm and close your hand around it. \"You mustn\'t open your hand until you are free of this place,\" it will say, as a fitting good-bye.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Now you must turn and leave, and do not look back. Once you escape the sewer, and if you are lucky, you may open your fingers. What you will find there is a green plastic army man toy.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That toy is Object 14 of 538.

Don\'t ask any questions, because he won\'t speak to you, and in the case that he does, you will wish he hadn\'t. He will take you down a long hallway and you will walk with him for what will seem like hours. Stare straight ahead the entire time, for if you look at the floor, walls, or ceiling of the hallway, you will run into a dead end and the worker will pursue you with a hellish bloodlust until you are completely disemboweled.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>After exactly 350 paces the worker will stop, turn around, and pull a watch out of his pocket. He will turn the dial backward one hour and at that point, you will have one hour to complete your task. If you don\'t, then there are no words to describe your fate. The lights will go out for exactly 3 seconds, and when they turn back on, you will be in a room with no doors and a red-tinted skylight shaped like a pentagram. This will cast a blood-red star in the middle of the room where a splintered cherry table with two seats will be. Sitting at the seat closest to you, look up. Look down again, and a man with long, dirty black hair will be face-down on the table. He will answer to one question: \"Where did He once stand?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The man will speak not of a place that exists on any map, but will describe the room in painfully grotesque detail.

When you reach the front desk, ask to see someone who calls himself the \"Holder of the Future\". Do not follow if the attendant offers to show you the way; he is not the true guide, and will lead you into madness. The true guide will fall silent and hand you a sheet of paper on which the way forward is written in lines of blood and fire. Walk forward, concentrating on the writing. If your focus doesn\'t waver, you will pass through both desk and man to find yourself in a long, disused hallway. It may once have seemed opulent, full of color and promise, but the walls are now stained and the carpet is black and filthy. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you pass through the hall images will flicker in previously-unseen windows. It may seem that, from the corner of your eye, you see friends long-dead beckon to you, or lost lovers turned young and new once more as they offer themselves to you again. Voices seem to whisper that the windows hold second chances, opportunities to make things right. You can choose again, they seem to say, but you mustn\'t look up from the paper in your hands. To do so is to glimpse fully what watches you from outside, and that would leave you at an end truly beyond salvation. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Accounts differ as to the hallway\'s ultimate, impossible length. Some say that you must continue to walk until you have glimpsed each of all your possible futures through the windows. Others imply that the closer the time of uniting approaches, the shorter one will find the journey to the end of the hall. If the latter is true, may all who enter find their path long beyond reckoning.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You may only look fully away from the paper at the end of the hallway, and even there you may never look behind you. The door before you leads into a ballroom that, like the hallway, has fallen from its former bright elegance into filth and despair. Move forwards into the gloom until the door and all chance of escape are lost behind you. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Walk with care. The Holder watches you even now. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The path forward once passed straight through the center of the room, but the center has not held over the many years, and the way has...drifted. You may never find your way if it has drifted too far, and you will spend the rest of your unnaturally long life wishing you had given yourself to the windows\' half-glimpsed temptations. If you are fortunate, however, you will find a single point where the little light remaining fades away completely, and there you must close your eyes and wait, regardless of what should happen next. If you have pleased the Holder, you will come to hear a cat\'s soft purr, and you will feel its warmth twining around your feet.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must keep your eyes closed until a voice has asked you \"What will you do with them?\" three times. To answer the first or second time will turn the purrs to snarls as the touch of a thousand razored claws pricks your throat. Only after the third and final time may you open your eyes.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>In front of you will be a woman lying on a bed. As with the rooms that preceded her chamber she might long ago have been stunningly beautiful, and though she lies naked on her bed she is nauseatingly fat, her skin pockmarked with bedsores and dead flesh and syphilitic blooms. Hundreds of cats cluster around her; eventually one will come to stand expectant at your feet. Speak only to this one, telling him \"I will do what I must\". \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will then teach you the language of the cats, and once you have learned the others will tell you a secret that was never meant for human ears.

As you get closer you see that the tree is constructed out of bones and it is surrounded in a pool of blood.

Drink from the vial and you find yourself standing in the lobby of the hospital.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This vial is Object 22 of 538. The hour is nigh and the demons are calling. <br><br>'),

Should you gaze out of this window your eyes will soon burst from your sockets and your screams will be your only utterance for all eternity. The room is small, the walls covered in blood, and a small cloaked figure sits in the middle. It will respond to only one question: \"Why do they hate?\" The figure\'s cloak will fly into the air revealing a grotesquely disfigured being. It will answer your question in horrific detail. Upon finishing the story it will collapse, as if a tremendous burden has passed from its shoulders, and crawl into the corner. You will begin to hear strange, unearthly shrieks from beyond the door.

You must wait precisely eight seconds before taking it, or the colors themselves will deny you, and you may not enter.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The warden will stand and lead you to a cell, opening the door for you and motioning for you to enter.  Inside the cell you will find two little boys, both garbed in shades of grey, and their skin and hair will appear as if all the color was drained out of them.  One has long hair and wears a white dress, while the other wears a black suit and has hair cut short.  Only look into the white one\'s eyes, for they are normal, and the eyes of the black-clothed boy will lead you into madness.  Each will wear one glove and hold out both their hands to you.  Take only the gloved hand of each, for should you touch the black-clothed boy\'s flesh, you will be plagued with the worst agony in all the universe but you will not die and he will not let go. Should you touch the white-clothed boy\'s flesh, you will feel more pleasure than you have ever experienced, but he will soon pull his hand away, and you will never feel that pleasure again, no matter how you yearn for it; your lust will kill you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The boys will look at each other and nod once; should they shake their heads, close your eyes and quickly say, \"I am not what you seek, but I can change the tides.\"  Once you say this, they will both giggle and pull on your hands, opening a trap door in their cell and descending into darkness.  The boys will speak in unison, endlessly bragging about their riches, all the things they have. They will ask you many times if you are jealous; each time you must simply answer \"Yes.\"  Your fate now lies in the hands of these boys.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The stairs you descend are long, and grow ever narrower, until finally one boy will go in front and one in back.  Should the boy in black go in front, consider yourself lucky; life now is at your back.

They will stare after you, tears streaming down their faces, and tell you they can go no further, but point to the door.  You must enter.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The room is pitch black, save for a single beam of light at its direct center.  Standing in the light is a woman, much like the boys, completely stripped of color.  Her hair and gown both reach the earth, each as white as her flesh.  Her eyes are only whites, staring blankly at you.  If she should smile at you, you have amused her, and she will light up the entire room with her light and you will become one of the writhing bodies that makes up the collection beneath her glass floor.  Should she frown at you, she will turn her back and light up the part of the room behind her, awakening seven other beings: a cackling man who wears just black, a weeping man garbed in white, a snarling man with piercing red eyes, a grimacing woman who wears only pink petals, an emotionless girl enveloped in green, a sickly man with silver hair, and a smirking gentleman covered in riches.  They are to be your judges.  You must the pick the one that you feel will do you justice and walk towards them, asking along your way, \"When will they strip you of this earth?\"  Should you choose the wrong color, the one you have chosen will stand very still and smile at you eerily, and you will soon feel yourself slipping away into nothingness.  Should you have chosen the correct color, they will respond with a hideous screech, pointing fearfully at the woman in the center of the room.  The others will scream curses at you in many different languages and you will feel piercing pain rip through your body.  Soon, the one you have chosen will step forward to embrace you, and whisper in your ear their sickening tales, the stories of your demise, of the demise of the world when every breath will fade away.  Do not move.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The curses will stop and the room will be lit, the seven all staring at you.  Where the woman was there will now be a small feather, like that of a dove, changing its color continuously.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This feather is object 24 of 538.

Strewn across the entirety of this room are the bodies of the stillborn and the fetuses of the unborn.

Closer examination of the suckling infant will leave you pondering its true age.  Its expression seems weathered and careworn, an eternal, knowing glance assuring you that its eyes have forgotten more than most will ever see.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Approach the mother, calmly.  Should you startle her and interrupt the feeding, your only hope is to whisper, \"I wish not to disturb you, nor your beautiful son.\"  If you have appeased her, position yourself so as to gaze directly into the child\'s eyes.  Once there, you must not break eye contact for fear of upsetting the infant and bringing about your own doom. You may ask him one question and one question only: \"For what have we been created?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The baby will move and wrap his tattered cloth around you, binding you and rending you limb from limb, yet you must not react to the pain or risk never returning to your original form.

The truth of the origin of the Seekers will be brought to life, and if you\'re not driven insane by this truth, you will feel the warmth of this knowledge glowing inside you. This heat will grow until the pain of the burn outweighs that of your torn flesh a thousandfold.  You will feel your body melt away, burning into nothing save ash.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>At the peak of your anguish, if you have managed to remain stoic, you will blink the eyelids which you no longer have, opening them to find you have returned outside, exactly one day before the incident. In your hands you will find a tattered manuscript, the text of which seems to predate existence.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This Object is 25 out of 538.

He didn\'t expect this ridiculous ritual to work at all, but after all, the only thing he had at risk was about an hour\'s wasted time and maybe a little embarrassment. He approached the woman working at the reception desk and asked in a quiet whisper if he could visit the one who called himself \"The Holder of Perspective.\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>What happened next surprised him a little: the receptionist nodded her head solemnly, just as the instructions said she would. \"Okay,\" he thought. \"Apparently  I\'m not the first one to pull something like this. Chances are she\'s read these things and is just playing along.

God, why did I think this had the slightest chance of working?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>His rambling, self-deriding thoughts were silenced, however, once she unlocked the chained double doors and he saw the long, narrow stairs leading up far higher than the building should have physically allowed.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\"Holy shit, these things are actually real.\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>James ascended the stairs with caution. As expected, once he reached a certain height, he began to see images projected onto the walls. They were the largest and deadliest disasters of humankind; the destruction of Pompeii, the ravages of the Black Plague, the Holocaust, 9/11. The images showed these tragedies through the eyes of each and every victim. It was all James could do to prevent being consumed by sorrow and grief, but he knew well the price for letting himself succumb to despair. Besides, beyond his wildest expectations he\'d already made it this far; he couldn\'t let himself fail now.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>After a long and tiring climb, he finally made it to the top of the stairs where an ornate marble wall with several tiny, eye-shaped glass windows awaited. He remembered his instructions and put his left eye into the window with a perfect vertical crack down the middle. In an instant his viewpoint shifted from his own body to that of an ancient man in a oval stone chamber. The man was using his slender, bony fingers to trace patterns over a large glass eye. James felt his grasp on his own mind weakening, so before he lost his mind completely, he thought as hard as he could, \"How will They see the End?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>In an instant, thousands of images started flashing before his eyes. They were images of the same scenes he\'d viewed in the hall, only this time they were from the eyes of outside observers. Feelings of apathy, grief, and joy flooded him all at once. The last image he saw was of an endless inferno; at this, there was no emotion other than sheer unbridled horror. Already physically and mentally drained from the journey up to this point, James could no longer handle the strain and collapsed where he stood.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>---------\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Ah, another poor Seeker who couldn\'t handle my visions. Very few have the mental strength for it, you see, and for good reason; no ordinary person was ever meant to witness the vision of the End, and certainly not an amateur like that one.

If at any time you begin to feel fear, get up and leave. You are still free to escape. If you choose to stay, you must sit and wait until the lights in the room flicker. Do not stand. Do not get up. If you are not sitting down when the lights flicker, then you will plummet into the void between worlds, a meal for its grotesque denizens. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When the lights flicker, you must shut your eyes immediately. Gazing upon the void will destroy your mind. Only when you hear a man clear his throat may you open your eyes. You will be in a dark dungeon, bound to the chair by a web of ebony chains. Surrounding you will be heads impaled upon blood-soaked pikes, and standing before you will be a man wearing an executioner\'s uniform. Stare him in the eyes; do not move your gaze and do not show even the slightest tinge of fear, for if you do, he will add your head to his collection. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The only thing you may speak without being beheaded is the question, \"What will they bring?\" The executioner will laugh an inhuman laugh, and then the impaled heads will begin to speak. They will speak of horrors, of executions, of their individual ends, but you must not move your gaze from the executioner, or you too will be speaking of your death. Eventually, he will speak of his own end, of what they brought to him. When he finishes, he will remove his cowl, revealing a skeleton\'s face. With a cackle, he will wave his hands, and the world will plunge into darkness. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When the light returns, you will be sitting peacefully in the lobby of the institution. In your lap will be the executioner\'s cowl. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That cowl is Object 34 out of 538. You have seen what they bring; will you stop them? <br><br>'),

If you do, you will immediately hit the spike-ridden bottom of the pit and meet a gruesome death. If you remain resolute, your fall will eventually slow and stop, leaving you in a room soaked in darkness. Into the darkness, you must speak only one thing: \"What is their weapon?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Immediately the room will be illuminated. Surrounding you will be everything that you fear, and in the center will be a creature who will take the appearance of your greatest fear. Not even once can you flinch or shrink away from this creature, or it will dismember you in the most painful way possible. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must stare at your greatest fear while it tells you its story in excruciating detail. It will tell you of all the fears in the world, from the tiniest to the greatest, in all of their horribleness. When it is finished, the creature will ask what you fear. Now you must confess all of your fears to the creature, without looking around the room. If you miss even one, you will be consumed by your own terror, leaving nothing but a shell remaining. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you confess all of your fears, the creature will scream, and the scream will send you hurtling through the wall behind you. When you stop moving, you will be across from the closet you entered earlier, and in the closet will be a mirror. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That mirror is Object 35 of 583.

He will lead you inside and lock you there. The door will not open, and it will be pitch black.

The worker will motion to the end of the hallway, and promptly leave you without a word. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must walk to the end of the hallway, without speaking a word. Once you reach the end, place your hands upon the wall to reveal that it is an illusion which you may walk through. If you are scared, or unsure of what is behind the wall when you step through, or have any doubts at all, you will simply walk off of the plane of existence forever, never to be heard from again. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>But if you believe in yourself, and believe answers lie beyond the wall, when you step through you will appear in a bright white room with many paths.

It appears to be everything, and nothing. Equals and opposites are meaningless in this room. It is said that most who enter are driven to a maddening insanity and begin to claw their own flesh off, or disembowel themselves with their bare hands, all while laughing manically. Never dying, this will be their fate for eternity. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Should you manage to not be driven to insanity, you will notice a nondescript figure standing in the center of the madness. It appears to be human, yet at the same time, something much more hellish. You will not be able to comprehend this entity visually, but you must not repulse at its sight, nor can you say anything to it. It will begin to speak to you many events. Some of which you know are true. Others you know are lies. Some which you are unsure of. The entity will become increasingly agitated that you are ignoring its nonsense. You MUST refrain from saying anything at all, until the entity falls silent briefly, and then asks: \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\"What would you do, if they were all brought together?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>To this, you must very firmly reply: \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\"Everything that you would do.

He does not like slackers, so quickly ask him your question. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The only one he will respond to is: \"Where do I go, Sir?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will tell you. He will tell you in such detail, such <i>horrifying</i> detail, that you will be tempted to strangle him. Do <i>not</i> try it- he is a far more experienced fighter than you could ever hope to be, and should you break salute, you will meet an extremely messy demise. When he is done, he will say \"at ease\", and hand you his pistol. This is your cue to drop salute. Take the sidearm and put it in your holster- if you did not have one before, you do now. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>An explosion will suddenly decimate the far wall and atomize the general.

The sounds of horrid battle will fade away until, out of the silence, a single gunshot rings out. Open your eyes. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You are standing in the middle of a field of waving wheat. Somehow, you know that this is where the horrific battle you walked through will take place. And you also know, somehow, that you will be in the general\'s place. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The pistol he handed you is Object 44 of 538. Learn how to use it- it has one magazine left.

Storm up to the front desk with a look of rage on your face, and demand to see a person who calls themselves \"The Holder of Peace\" immediately. The attendant will recoil, and ask you to speak softly. Do not comply with his request- if anything; speak louder- for the anger in your voice is all that keeps the chains locked on the door behind the desk.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Keep the anger in your voice- the attendant will duck under his desk and point with a quivering finger down a hall to the right that was not there before. Immediately turn and stomp off down the hall. Do not look over your shoulder, for should the attendant catch you- and he will- he will casually lean back and flip the lock off the door behind him. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Walk until you find a door with a beautiful mother-of-pearl inlay design. Throw it open, but take the rage off your face <i>immediately</i>- the ones inside do not appreciate such anger. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>With a peaceful look across your face, enter. You are in a beautiful, open-aired temple, with ivy curling up the marble pillars and beautiful mosaics embroidering the walls. The door will lock behind you. Do not try to open it, for it never will, and the monks in brown robes you see wandering about will do anything to get you to stay- even if it means your death. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Wander around. No matter what language you speak, the monks speak it too. They\'re friendly, and all of them would love to chat, but politely decline. Tell them you must speak with the Head of the Order. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Eventually you will be directed to a man sitting at a chessboard - the temple\'s abbot. The figure across from him is hooded and wearing armor. Do not attempt to speak to the hooded figure, or your death will be far worse than any vision of hell that man could conjure up. Instead, turn to the man in the now-familiar brown robes. The game is one move away from checkmate. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Bow, and ask nicely, \"Why do they gather, Father?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will open his mouth as if to speak. But the figure across from him will let out a demonic howl of rage and draw a sword. It is beautifully crafted, but seems somehow stained with an unthinkable evil. With a yell, the figure will kick you down and begin systematically slaughtering the other monks. They will try to fight back, but they have only staves, and the sword the madman wields is so sharp that it slices through the pillars like a knife through butter. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you are watching this, the abbot will make the final move in the game. The man in armor will swing around, and then run at you with the sword upraised. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you were rude or did something wrong, you will be rent at the atomic level by the blade of the sword, and the pain will never cease. However, if you were polite, the abbot will step in front of you and jam the black king into the right eye of the warrior. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Pay no heed or sympathy as he falls to the ground, screaming, or the abbot will whirl around and do the same to you with the white king. Instead, focus on the abbot, who has now turned around to face you. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will tell you why they gather. It is a long tale, so fraught with bloodshed and horror that it may well snap your mind. But if you survive its telling, he will reach under the table with the chessboard and pass you a scabbard richly jeweled and inlaid with gold. Though you have never seen it before, you instinctively know that it matches the sword the warrior was wielding a moment ago. Do not hesitate- take it, walk over, pick up the madman\'s sword, wipe it, and sheath it. Buckle it on as well- you will have need of it. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Move to leave, but before you do, the good Father will halt you and gesture towards the, now un-hooded, face of the warrior. He was handsome, but pay no heed to that. The one thing you should be focusing on is the fact that the black king is gone. Look up at the abbot, who will nod and say one word: \"Regicide\". \r\n<br>\r\n<br>A flash of light will blind you, and when your sight returns you will be standing on the curb two blocks down from the asylum. Step back onto the sidewalk- you don\'t want to have an accident. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The sword you now wield once belonged to the white king, and is Object number 45 of 538.

Once the door closes behind you the hallway will be lit by an ethereal light, to reveal the walls of the hallway made of mirrors. The reflections stretch out to infinity on either side of you, but none of them show your reflection; they show the reflection of those who came before you. Each reflection shows another who sought the Holder, each shows how they died. Try not to look at their faces as the beasts devour them; try not to look at all, just walk in a straight line. If you look, if you watch, the beasts in the reflections will see you, too, and they will come for you. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If ever the light begins to dim, if you begin to lose your way in the darkness, close your eyes tight and say firmly, without fear, \"The ones you seek have gone before\".

He will tell you what the Holders mean, why they exist, and what is to come. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After he tells you this, he will step into your vision, revealing who he is.

In the gazebo\'s shade rests a beautiful woman in a dress that echos the colors of the garden. She will gesture for you to sit on her left; she likes you and she has a task for you to complete for her. Without words or gestures, she will ask you to find her a flower in her garden. It\'s best to do as she asks; you are, after all,she is your friend and it best to be in her graces.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>She will keep the description of the flower a secret; she is testing you, after all. If you are destined for your role, or if your luck continues, you will come upon two interwoven trees, each producing a different flower. Choose wisely, for if you displease your hostess it would be more advisable to smash your skull upon the rocks than to face her discontent. If you choose the right flower, then simply head back to the gazebo and give it to her.

You must wait until the mortician leaves the room, (which will be quite a long while). Before he leaves, he will state the scientific name of a location in the body and will take his leave. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Stand until the mortician leaves the room, and do nothing until he does. When he leaves, look in the book for the name of that place in the body, and use the knife to split that part of the body open. Place the gold bar in that part, and thread it up. Only one of the needles will completely remove the scar, so choose wisely. Do all this while holding a stoic expression on your face. After you have completed your task, the room will go dark, and you must yell in a clear voice, \"See? I have prepared a gift for you, take what is yours.\" I will then appear in all my unearthly glory, and judge. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you had a reaction from anytime the mortician left the room up until the lights went dark, or the scar remains, your soul will be mine to take as well as the gift, and you will both be taken to my lair.

Remain with a lack of expression on your face, or I will decapitate you, not so bad an end as to others in this journey. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When I find it, I will Smile.

You will realise that the same is happening to you, and that I have just infected you with my Disease. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When the blackening will cease to flow from your body, it will have turned night; stare only at the pentagram. A demonic audience is watching you, and they tend to rip people to shreds if they look at them, so keep your gaze fixed upon the pentagram. They will dance around you in a devilish flurry, taunting you, mocking you, spitting on you and the like. If you remain stoic, then they will leave. After they have all left, the blackening will return, and ignite a random number of candles around the pentagram. Count and remember this number; it will serve you well at The End. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The light will return and you will awaken outside of the morgue, around mid-day.

Should you step through this portal fearfully, he will close it when you are only halfway through, trapping your soul in the dark abyss that connects the dimensions for all eternity. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you make it through safely, though, you will find yourself in a garden. A garden more beautiful and lush than any forest or jungle known to man, demon, and angel. The garden seems to stretch on in to infinity, and in front of you, you will see a path. Follow it, but do not stray, for if you do the beasts of the garden will attack and begin to slowly tear the layers of your body off over what seems to be an eternity, and you\'ll be conscious for all of it.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>After what may seem anywhere from five minutes to five months of walking, you will come upon a quaint home. Knock on the front door, and if you should hear a voice saying, \"You are not welcome here, stranger,\" there is no hope for you. No praying will save you here. Your death will be horrible. If you hear a voice saying, \"Please, come in,\" you may open the door and go in. He has welcomed you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Inside, you will see an old man in a rocking chair, reading by the fire. He will only respond to one question, \"What started it all?\" The man will begin to change his shape right in front of you. The wrinkles on his face and arms will begin to fade, and his muscles will begin to take shape, as if he were getting much younger. He will stand and ask you to come to him. Don\'t. As much as he may tempt you to, do not. Stare directly into his eyes, and without breaking eye contact, inquire once more, \"What started it all?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once you say this again, the fire will jump from the fireplace and surround the man. He will begin to speak, in a voice as loud as the roaring sea, yet as soft as a gentle breeze. He will explain the beginning of life, the Objects, and all of the universe. When he is finished, the fire will reside, and the man will be gone. In his place will be a marble on the floor. This marble is as red as fire, yet as blue as the sea. As clear as the wind, but as black as the earth. Do not try to comprehend this marble, for it will twist your mind into madness. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Pick up the marble and leave through the door you came through, and you will be back in the main lobby of the institution.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The marble is Object 64 of 538.

When you reach the front desk, ask to visit something which calls itself \"The Holder of Agony\". The eyes of the person behind the counter will widen in surprise, as if they didn\'t understand why they recognized the name. They\'ll sputter for a moment, but their facial expression will soon change to a drawn, furrowed, pensive scowl. They will shudder, turn away, and refuse. You must ask again, and continue asking in a calm, soft voice, even if they weep or scream. Eventually, the life will leave their eyes, and they will lead you, with a shuffling gait, to a room with no apparent number just down the hall. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The worker will open the door for you. As you walk past to enter the dark room, they will land a sharp kick on the small of your back, hurtling you into the room. Whatever you do, do not stop or turn around while passing the worker. Please just trust me on that. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The room will smell simultaneously of alcohol sanitary wipes and the metallic tang of blood. You won\'t be able to see much until the same door you entered through opens, and the gray light from without illuminates a lanky, cloaked figure entering the room. When the door shuts, it will be darker than before. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Immediately, you will feel the cloaked figure press itself against your body. Its bony limbs will jab your ribs and stomach as it says, \"I know you\". Its voice will reverberate through your entire body, and you will feel every type of discomfort - like you\'re being watched, being molested, like your foot fell asleep, like you\'re dizzy, nauseous, impatient. Stand perfectly still. Make no sound, except to ask: \"Why are they in pain?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>It will reply, in its gut-wrenching hiss, \"I will hold you here for all time, and every night, I will mutilate you, rape you, and murder you.\" You will have no time to brace yourself or think, and especially no time to move, before you feel a wicked, jagged blade thrust into your abdomen and come out the other side. You will feel its rough surface grating against your organs. Do not move. Do not speak. <i>Do not scream</i>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The voice will continue. \"I will murder everything you love, and make them see your face as their killer. I will ruin everything you find beautiful. I will twist your mind until you are as grotesque and perverted as the rest of us.\" It will not stop, even as fiery, acidic pain lances through your nerves from the blade in your gut. The pain will stop your breath and perhaps your heart, but you must remain perfectly still. More of the blades will pierce your body, in soft places, in impossible places, and the voice will continue hissing its deadly vows, its baroque tortures that become so creatively inhuman and meticulously soulless that you will be in danger of losing your mind. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Stillness is your only defense. If you move, the blades, growing in number from one to five to thirty to a hundred or a thousand, if only you had a chance of counting, will tear away in every direction, forcing every chunk of your flesh and nerves to stay conscious and aware as they are rent apart again and again forever. Stay still, even as your entire body is wracked with agony that couldn\'t possibly exist; you would be wishing for a reprieve of snake bites on your eyes and razor blades in your nerves. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must listen to the voice carefully, for eventually, it will say one of two things. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If it says, \"This glory is reserved for those who have proven themselves,\" then I can offer only my condolences. Your eternal suffering will be so insanely horrible that anyone on Earth who has seen your face or heard your name will have nightmares of your agony even after they have passed on to the afterlife in Heaven or Hell. Your soul will be a wasted husk. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If it says, \"Your whole existence of forever is untouched by this agony,\" you must reply, quickly and confidently, \"The agony fills us all until they have stopped hurting.\" For every second it takes to muster your reply through the haze of unbelievable pain, you will suffer from another unique and unerring agony for the rest of your life. If you cannot speak, you will never know another moment without torture, and each day you will consider the prior day\'s pain to be the tickle of a feather. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you reply correctly, everything will stop - the pain, the hissing - and you will feel the figure, once pressed against you, crumbling into nothingness. Lift the cloak and you will find a leather pouch. Open it only if you want to know what it would be like for the world to be torn asunder by a plague that even Hell wouldn\'t condone. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>This tortured dust is Object 65 of 538.

When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Greed\". If a look of ravenous hunger comes over them, run from the institution, for if you do not, you will be eaten alive in the most painful way possible. However, if a look of tired want comes over them, they will take you to a cell in a corridor that wasn\'t there before. The walls will be made of fine gold and silver, but do not touch it, lest They devour your soul. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you walk, if at any time you hear the sound of coins jingling, stop and yell quickly, \"All that glistens is not gold!\" If it continues, you are damned for all eternity, and there is no point in running. However, if it stops, continue. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Eventually, you will come to a gilded door. The worker will open it, and close their eyes as you enter. As you enter, the door will close behind you. Inside is an exquisite palace, crafted of ivory and gold and wonders that no mortal man has ever built or conceived. Do not dwell too long, as if you do, the world will open under you, and you will be eternally trapped in a world of filth and squalor. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you continue, the palace around you will slowly and increasingly drip blood, until a torrent of blood rains down on you.

(67, 'Holder of the Cosmos', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. Get the front receptionist\'s attention and ask to visit someone called \"Holder of the Cosmos\". He will look you up and down. If he mutters and walks away, stay in place - he will return momentarily. Upon his arrival he will unlock a trapdoor beneath his desk and motion for you to follow. He will lead you down an ancient, creaking staircase made of wooden planks. It remains somehow suspended in an impossibly large room, the sides or bottom of which you will not be able to fathom. The only light will be from the quickly receding entryway. Vast, hulking shapes lumber in the darkness - I recommend that you do not make any noises louder than the gentle squeaking of the stairs. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Your guide will remain only a few steps ahead of you, but in the oppressive darkness his features remain unclear. You will be descending the stairs for what seems like an eternity. During this time, do not let your thoughts wander. Focus entirely on your objective - the Keeper of the Cosmos. As you sink farther into the blackness, wooden planks swaying beneath your feet, your guide\'s form may seem to shift. It is not a trick of your eyes. If he stops at any time, throw yourself from the stairs immediately - an eternity of falling would be preferable to his torment. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>However, should he continue to move, you will eventually begin to feel a wind pick up. Far below you, the tops of trees will become visible. Above your head, a vault of stars and clouds. To your sides, a vast and unimpeded horizon, save for one structure far to your right. As you descend further, you can see it is a mansion with a small dirt road leading from it. This part of the descent is incredibly peaceful and will last for several hours. Enjoy it, but do not under any circumstance look back from where you came. The rickety staircase will collapse and you will plummet to your death. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Eventually you will reach the bottom of the stairs. They will have deposited you in a thickly wooded forest, a few yards from a dirt road. Your guide will stop moving. In the sparse shafts of moonlight filtering down between the trees, you will notice that he has changed considerably. Where once stood a man now stands a hellish, hulking beast. He will begin to turn. You must run. The staircase you recently descended will have disappeared. Your only choice is the road. The demon is slow, but he will not relent. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Run. Run until your lungs burn and your chest heaves. Run until your throat is slick with blood. Until you cannot run any longer. Give up hope. Fall to your knees. Weep. You will feel the demon\'s breath at your heels, and you will mumble a prayer into the dirt road as you see your life flash before your eyes. At that very moment, as you have lost all hope, a gunshot will roar into the void of the darkened forest road. The demon at your back will have been slain. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>This next moment is crucial. No matter how winded you are, you must stand up and immediately say: \"Who is their enemy?\" If you wait a split second too long you will be blown to bits in a similar fashion to the demon. However, if you are fast enough, an elegantly dressed gentleman on a horse will trot out of the darkness a few steps down the road. He appears rather young and is holding an ornately crafted, 18th century pistol in his right hand. He has several large tomes strapped to the saddlebags of his horse and bits of script in a foreign language are visible pasted, in a fashionable way, to various bits of his clothing. He will slowly approach you, making no move to dismount, but visibly interested in your appearance. You must hold his gaze until he disappears in the opposite direction. Following this exchange your exhaustion will suddenly catch up with you, and you will find it increasingly difficult to stay awake. Give in to your weariness and sleep. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will awake the next day in your bed, clutching a rough piece of paper. On it, in an elegant script, are written the words: \"You are a fool.\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That man is the Holder of the Cosmos, and he still holds Object 67 of 538. He defends the cosmos from their revival. Now that he knows your intentions, he will do anything to stop you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>There is, however, an alternate option. You must already bear <a href=\"?Holder_of_Understanding\" class=\"yespage\">the Widowmaker</a> for this to work. Instead, when you rise, ask the Holder not, \"Who is their enemy?\" but instead show him Object 186. If you do, his eyes will widen in surprise and he will dismount. In his hand will be the white, ornate 18th-century pistol he used moments previously to save you. It is the brother of Object 186. He will then ride into the distance, soon fading.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The Holder of Cosmos has relinquished the Gravebringer, Object 67 out of 538. You have freed him - but at what cost?

(68, 'Holder of the Negative', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. Get the front receptionist\'s attention and ask to visit someone called \"Holder of the Negative\". If the receptionist adamantly refuses to help you, immediately turn, leave the institution behind and take the fastest possible route home. After a fortnight of hiding you will know whether their trackers have found you. However, if the receptionist merely nods at you with a stony expression and gestures for you to follow, do so. He will lead you to a seemingly innocent-looking hospital room and leave. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>As soon as the door locks, push the bed aside to reveal a decrepit wooden trap door underneath. Use the bed to block the door - the clock is ticking and the sentinels are already on their way. Open the trap door to find a dusty and grimy gray metal coffin in a shallow pit dug into the floor. Open the locks on the side and lift the lid. If the coffin is empty, lay yourself inside and close both the trap door and the coffin lid. If there is somebody already in there, well - I would recommend trying to snap your own neck before the coffin\'s previous resident does. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must lie inside the coffin for exactly four minutes and thirteen seconds. Until this time, <i>do not open the lid</i>. What would come to pass if you did is beyond the description of mortal men. When the required time has passed, you may knock twice on the metal lid. If there is no answer, knock thrice more. If the coffin trembles slightly in response, you may push the lid off. If the coffin remains silent, you know your life expectancy is now a minute at best. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Push the lid aside to emerge in what seems like the dark, blasted remains of a bizarre underground machine shop. The blotched, ocher metal walls and the gray dust of time over the disengaged, quiet computing devices speak in their own way about the hundreds of thousands battles which were planned, organized and miserably lost in the very same room you are now sitting in. As alien and intricate the machinery may be, don\'t dally. Rise to your feet and reach your right hand out to find a wall. Fumble around until you find a metal lever sticking out of it - it\'s roughly at your shoulder level. If the room starts to emit an increasingly loud whirring, <i>do not panic</i>. Instead, call out sternly into the blackness: \"It\'s the last piece of knowledge we require.\" If the whirring dies down, continue your search. If it doesn\'t, the machinery will engage in their last integration routine with you as their target. When you find the switch, throw it. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The last operational generator will start up with a painful whine, powering little else but the few good light fixtures around the floor. In the core of the still dim room, you will see a huge, brass-colored and impossibly complex mechanical device which most closely resembles a crossover between an opulent metal throne and a Victorian-era life support system. Amidst the zigzagging tubes, pipes, valves, cogs and plates you can see a gaunt, inhumanly frail corpse barely clinging on to its life. As intimidating as the throne may be, enter the creature\'s presence and matter-of-factly utter the query: \"Who scattered them for the first time?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Your question sparks a new light in his milky gray eyes, and with the spite and frustration of countless generations in his raspy, mechanically amplified voice he will recite to you all of the stories, all tales of vain heroism, every broken union and all of the heart-wrenchingly disappointing failures of all of those who came before you. His contagious despair will punch through your skin, slither past your flesh and pierce through your bones, but take heed not to lose your focus - he is still their slave and his corrupted side will readily consume you if given the opportunity. He will tell you of those who first knew of their convergence, how they scattered the objects and broke their unholy union and what made those first fail and perish. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When he is done, he will slowly and painfully extend his hand out to you from within the metal shell. Do not take his hand. Instead, cross your arms across your chest and exclaim: \"Your flawed routines are not mine to embrace!â€ Leaning against one of the mysterious devices is a thin, two-pronged metal staff. Grab it, and using all the power you can possibly muster, drive it through the only exposed vital part in his body - his head. His death will be swift. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When his rotten body and the infernal device lie silent, reach inside the metal shell protecting the body and fumble around the inner workings of the machine. As soon as your hand hits a part pulsing heat, yank it out. It should come off easily. Retreat as fast as you can back into the zinc coffin - you have killed the only entity which upheld the order of the place and it won\'t be long until the room is going to unmake itself and crumble into the void. Slam down the lid, close your eyes, and if you are lucky, you will near-instantly drift off into sleep. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When you wake up, you will wake up in your own home, in your own bed, tightly hugging a warm chunk of metal to your chest. You would be wise to get rid of the coffin around you at earliest opportunity. It evokes awkward questions\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This corrupted golden gear is the Object 68 of 538.

Then, you will be led down a hallway, ending at a flight of stairs. The attendant will leave you at this point.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Ascend the stairs. They will go on for what seems like miles. If your step falters at any time, or you take time to rest, even a moment of respite, your focus will quickly lose clarity until it fades away entirely. If your consciousness returns thereafter, you may find yourself at whatever place you call home, and the institution will have essentially vanished from existence. If this is the case, thank whatever entity you wish that the least likely outcome came to pass.

The wall to your left will have many doors. Do not open any of them under any circumstances, regardless of what sensations you feel urging you to do so. These feelings are scarcely more than base trickery. The doors restrain segments of your psyche mercifully shut away; to free them now is a grave mistake. The wall to your right is composed entirely of glass. Looking out this enormous window reveals whatever place you were born in, though entirely empty and devoid of life.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Walk the hallway. Its length is variable, so this may take even longer than your recent climb. At the opposite end, you will see a set of double doors.

Overcome this feeling, and step into the blackness within. Before long, a single spotlight will turn on from somewhere in the darkness above you, and all things within the spotlight will be made clear.

It is best that you do not look too closely at the shifting images beyond the region of clarity.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The rings on the ground will indicate to you that you are in some kind of a circus tent, standing in the center ring.

Speak as though you are addressing a crowd of thousands, or the ringmaster before you will have to remove you from the stage in a manner aimed to please the beings currently watching. Their sense of entertainment differs significantly from that of any human; hope that you do not find out how.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you appeased the ringmaster, he will crack his whip. The sound will seem impossibly loud, and will be accompanied by a blinding flash of light. He will be gone, and in his place, two other people will have appeared. To your left stands the object of your hatred: whomever you have borne more resentment towards than any other you have known. To your right, the one most dear to you. Living or dead, these people will appear in the flesh in front of you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Approach your mortal enemy, and wordlessly, he will hand you a knife. You will feel a strong compulsion to drive it into his chest - you must resist this urge at all costs. Instead, you must use it to carve the heart from your loved one. They will be conscious throughout, and will scream relentlessly for you to stop, crying out to understand why. Do not listen, and do not hesitate in your task, for the audience wishes to see the weak shed blood, and you do not wish to prove you are a valid candidate.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Retrieve the heart, and pass it to the ringmaster who now stands behind you. He will then tell you in great detail your first thought that compelled you to take up your present journey, and all context surrounding it. For some, this once-obscured knowledge replacing a false construction of the mind can drive them to such desperation as to plunge the knife into their own chest. If you resist this temptation, your vision will blacken, and you will regain consciousness in whatever place you were born. The knife you used will lie next to you. It will be a coarse red, forever stained with the blood of all lives you have caused to end.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The knife is Object 69 of 538. You now have knowledge of why you began.

She will raise an eyebrow as if judging you but nonetheless will take you deeper into the library.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will see a door in the southeast wing of the building that you could swear would lead you outside. The librarian will stop at said door and knock three times. A voice that sounds similar to two sheets of sandpaper rubbing together will ask, \"Confident are thee, that triumph awaits at the end?\" You must answer \"Indeed, for I do not fail.\" Say this before the librarian answers that you are a failure. If she does this, your very soul will be crushed under the weight of your own  failure and she will feast on your flesh while you weep in your loss.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you answer in time (and confidently enough), the librarian will hiss and produce a dagger. DO NOT ATTACK HER, for her strength and speed are beyond legend. She will hand the blade off to you and open the door, whispering curses as you pass.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The path is well lit, with no end in sight. Mirrors line the path reflecting every victory, good and evil, since before time began. To look into any of these mirrors is to fail in the scenario it reflects. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The path stretches beyond time, and you must follow. After what seems like an eternity of walking, a large steel door will appear. A voice will beckon you closer. Keep your mind free of doubt. You must be sure of your triumph, lest you have your soul rent from you and tortured for eternity.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Step up to the door and knock seven times. If the voice brands you a failure, the horror you will see will force you to slice your own throat open with the dagger. If there is no answer, then enter.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The room will be dark. The inky darkness will be almost tangible. Ask your question: \"What will happen when he triumphs?\" The room will light up, revealing a naked figure of great height, with the physique of Adonis, every feature gleaming in perfection save for the fact that he has no face. He will rise and turn toward you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Ask again, \"What will happen when He triumphs?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The figure will cock his head sharply to the right and immediately lunge at you. DO NOT FLINCH, or he will beat you to death and feed off of your sanity. Instead, charge. But I warn you to attack with berserk ferocity or you will surely lose.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must not kill him, only incapacitate him. He will speak directly into your mind: \"Your perseverance serves.\" Do not thank him, instead yell, \"THRICE I SAY AND DONE! WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN HE TRIUMPHS?\" The figure will scream now, the sound threatening to implode your mind, and he will describe in gruesome detail the end of time, when He arrives. Stab the figure in the throat and remove his head. His head will serve as your trophy, a symbol of your triumph.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This trophy is Object 73 of 538. He knows who you are. Bask in His Triumph when the time comes. <br><br>'),
(74, 'Holder of the Mark', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of the Mark.\" The receptionist will freeze, as though he has known this moment was coming for a long time and is afraid it has finally arrived. He will stutter and tell you there is no such man here, but be insistent. He will eventually yield and after looking around to see if anyone else is here, he will beckon for you to follow him. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will lead you along corridors of increasingly smaller size, until you eventually have to stoop. He will point you to a door at the end of a corridor so small you have to crawl to get to the end. It will be perfectly normal except for a large exclamation mark in the centre and a smaller question mark on the doorknob. This is your last chance to turn away, and if you have the slightest hint of doubt in you I recommend you do so. If your will is strong, open the door gently and pull yourself through. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will emerge in an ornate hall, covered with wall paintings depicting famous historical dictators and murderers, butchers, rapists and serial killers. Do not linger on them, for the souls of the people reside in those pictures and the twisted hate of their life has been amplified in their death, waiting to reach out and rend you limb from limb, delighting in your slow and painful death. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When you finally reach the end of the hall, there will be a small wooden box with an insignia on it that is old and faded. You will feel a sharp tingle go up your spine as you behold this item and then a voice behind you will say: \"Beautiful, is it not?\" You must reply: \"As the full moon.\" If he is not satisfied with your response, pray he doesn\'t make you one of his paintings and instead gives you a painless death. But if he is satisfied, he will say: \"You ask?\" You <i>must</i> say exactly: \"How do we destroy them?\" He will laugh and say he doesn\'t know, but then will simply state, \"You\'re bound to think of something.\" You will then wake up in the nearest bathroom, your eye in excruciating pain. As the pain recedes, you will see that your pupil has now taken the shape of the mark on the box back in that room. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That mark is Object 74 of 538. It will allow you to behold the ultimate truth.  Whether or not the experience will be worth it is another matter. <br><br>'),
(75, 'Holder of Chance', 'In any city, in any country, seek out any school or educational facility you can find. When you reach the front desk, ask to see a person who calls himself \"The Holder of Chance.\" If the secretary shows any sign of fear, give the request again, and do not relent. Eventually your perseverance will pay off, and you will be led to a deserted classroom in a closed-down wing of the school. Scraps of police tape and faded chalk profiles will litter the floor, and the door will be sealed behind you before you can inquire anything. At this point you must choose one of the thirty desks, sit down and wait. Only one of these desks will allow you to keep your life; advising you to choose wisely would do little good, as there is no way to tell if you have done so until it is too late. After a short wait you should begin to hear things - children laughing, droning lectures, and the occasional snore - but these are merely echoes of a time when the classroom was host to nothing more devious than homework and pop quizzes.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you wait, the sounds will slowly change. Where there was once laughter and lectures, there will now be screams of agony and howls of despair. Shades of the classroom\'s horrible history will begin to take shape around you. Do not fear the shades, as they are harmless. The beast they can coalesce into, however, is not. As your wait continues, the shadows will grow more numerous and the classroom\'s history will unfold in increasingly gruesome detail. This part has driven many men into fits of tears and more still into madness. Should you reach the end of this macabre production with your sanity intact, you will find out if you have chosen wisely. If you have chosen incorrectly, the shades will take form. They are hideous mockeries of what they were in life, half-formed doppelgangers of those long dead. There is no escape from this room now. They will tear you apart ever so slowly, taking twisted delight in inflicting the pain they have suffered on someone else. It will take you days, perhaps even weeks, to die. The only consolation you will have is that you will likely lose your sanity after the first few hours.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you were lucky and chose the one correct desk, the shades will gather around you, coalescing into a pitch black mass. When it disappears, you will find yourself in the most lavish casino imaginable. It is populated by those who have played the games so long that their flesh has long since rotted away (for death is forbidden from entering this casino) and yet still play, hoping to gain their freedom. The casino has but two exits. One leads to a wasteland where fell beasts roam, and nothing but certain death awaits. The cost to pass through is four silver coins. The other door will take you to what you seek, and is the only chance for you to leave with your life. The cost to pass through is five gold coins. You will be holding a single silver coin in your hand. Don\'t fret; as long as you are in this casino, you can never have any less than this one coin. A nearby sign will tell you that three silvers equal one gold. You must play if you do not wish to be trapped here for good, but remember the old casino boss\'s idiom: \"You can\'t beat the house.\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Nearly every game is rigged in favor of the house and the precious few which aren\'t change at random, serving only to trick and confuse you. The odds are most definitely not in your favor. If you do begin to win, take care to keep your fortune as secret as possible, as the damned around you have not been so lucky. Bear in mind that you cannot die in this place and that boastfulness may inspire them to turn on you in a fit of jealous hatred, ripping great chunks of flesh out of your body until their jealousy is quenched and their bloodlust sated.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If, against all odds, you manage to gather the five gold coins and enter the door unmolested by the other gamblers, you will find yourself in an elevator. It will take you up to an office even more opulent than the casino below. Behind a desk at the far end of the room will sit a skeletal figure, dressed in the finest suit you will ever see. Approach the desk and stand before it, asking only one question: \"Will you roll?\" It will nod and produce a pair of dice from its jacket. Call the roll, evens or odds. If you lose, the skeleton will grin, and you will take its place, waiting thousands of years for the next Seeker to be so lucky as to reach your new abode. If you should win, however, it will let loose a wail that will unbind the magics that hold the place together. Death will finally enter the casino below, granting the wretched gamblers the rest that has for so long been denied them. As the casino disintegrates around you, stand perfectly still. Hopefully you will not be taken with it, but if you are, there is no being in this world who can say what will happen to you. If you were not taken, you will reappear in the classroom. It will be exactly the same as you left it save a mound of dust and rotting cloth at your feet. Within it you fill find a pair of dice. As soon as you touch them, the door will unlock.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That pair of dice is Object 75 of 538. With every roll, they take another life. Will yours be the next they claim?  <br><br>'),
(76, 'Holder of Fate', 'In any city, in any country, seek out any school or educational facility you can find. When you reach the front desk, ask to see a man who calls himself â€œThe Holder of Fate.â€ Halfway through your question, the secretary\'s face will light up with recognition, and she will produce an ornately decorated box. Opening it will yield you nothing but a bemused smile from the secretary, as it will be empty. After a moment, she will draw your attention back to her and lead you into the principal\'s office. After a few muttered words between the two, the principal will welcome you with a handshake, and proceed to open a trapdoor concealed under his desk. He will hand you a dagger and offer a few grim words of luck before lowering you into the hole and closing the door. For a moment, you will be in total darkness, but images will soon emerge in front of you. You will recognize them as moments from your own life, and as you watch, you may come to realize that they are all connected. Every moment of your life has culminated in this very moment, and it is only with this realization that proceeding forward will become possible. But worry not, for this is a timeless place. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When you have accepted your fate, a door will appear in front of you. Through it is a single room with a closed door at the far end, blocked off from you by a gate. Once you are clear of the door you entered from, it will slam shut, and a person will materialize in front of you. Confused, they may prompt you for an explanation, but regardless of your answer, a fight will inevitably begin. If, at any time during the fight, should your opponent\'s stomach be revealed, you will see that your own name is inscribed there. What this means, however, cannot be told. This battle will be one of the few moments of your life that is not scripted, and you will be well aware of the fact, as even moving your body will feel far more difficult than usual. Fortunately, the same holds true for your foe. Should you win the battle, the door at the far end of the room will open, and the gate will disappear. Fate will have lost its hold on you by this point, and what will happen to you beyond that door is beyond the knowledge of any being, but you can be certain that the chances of surviving without fate on your side are questionable at best. What is known, however, is that if you are an extremely lucky soul, you will eventually come to an ancient, rotting door. The doorknob will be lying on the ground before it, having long since rusted over and fallen from its place. One solid push is all it will take to open this door, and a cloud of dust will rise from the ground where it falls. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After the dust clears and you enter the room, you will be in an earthen cave. A small window, if it can be called that, will provide enough light for you to see three figures in the center of the room. The figures on the left and right, you will see as you draw closer, have been dead for many years. A stone is lodged in the skull of one, and the head of the second hangs at an awkward angle, its neck clearly broken. The figure in the center, however, still lives, despite its appearance, which clearly indicates that this being should have died centuries ago. The old crone, for that is what the center figure is, has only one eye. No ordinary eye, mind you, as it seems to shine with an otherworldly brilliance. Ask her this, and only this, lest she end your life in a manner so horrible that your worst fears would seem a blessing in comparison: \"What do you see?\" She will answer at her own pace, and impatience on your part will bring the full force of her considerable wrath upon you.  When she finally speaks, it will be in a tortured voice. She will tell you that she sees everything, but that she had lost sight of you as soon as your earlier battle started. Deciding that you are too great of a threat, she will attack you, with speed and strength seemingly impossible for her decrepit body to possess. You must act quickly, as one hit from her will destroy you utterly. Take the box you received earlier and open it. Be warned, though; the contents of that once empty box are not fit for human eyes, and if yours happen to be open when they emerge, your existence will end in a most terrifying manner. Once the box is opened, you will hear unearthly sounds. When they cease, close the box and open your eyes, but not a moment before. Looking around, nothing will have changed but for the crone. Time has caught up with her, as she will now be as dead as the other two figures in this room. Her eye is nowhere to be seen. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You now have two choices. Opening the box a second time will reveal an object that will grant you the power to control the past, present and future of the world, save for the room you reside in, and the ones you passed through after your battle. However, should you do this, you will be trapped in this room for all eternity, with no conceivable escape. Your second choice is to leave the room and brave whatever horrors you faced in order to get there. In either case, fate will no longer have any control over your life. Not long after, you will discover what a sickening burden it truly is to control your own destiny.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The Object that now lies within the box is number 76 of 538. There are some who are now aware of its existence.  May it never fall into the wrong hands. <br><br>'),

When you get to the front desk, ask to visit \"The Holder of Divinity\". Repeat this two more times before the worker responds. He should stiffen, looking straight upwards for a few seconds before looking back down at you with eyes of an indescribable color. You must then follow the worker, keeping your eyes on the ground, tracing his footsteps as exactly as you can. If you do not follow precisely, you will never find your way again. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When the worker stops, turn around and look up from the ground. Resist any urge to look behind you from this point on. You will find yourself facing a door, with a hideously shaped red dagger stabbed into the center. Grip its handle, and an incredible pain should slowly creep up the surface of your arm, then across your whole body, sinking deeper and deeper into your body. If at any time you release your hold on the dagger, the pain will never go away, even after you die. Once the pain reaches your heart, you should feel a sudden surge of demonic strength. Rip the dagger from the door and it will swing open, the pain vanishing as the dagger separates from the door. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must run through the doorway and through a long, arched hallway, which will open into a strangely lit circular room. Go straight for the man in the center. He will be kneeling, facing away from you, deep in prayer, completely in shadow but surrounded by a golden glow.

Do not try to comprehend his words; in your state they would destroy you. Listen only for the word \"sacrifice\". As soon as you hear this word, stab the dagger into his throat. His blood will seep onto the dagger, transforming it, and light will fill the room.

Once there, go to the closest officer to you and ask to see the \"The Holder of the Rails\". Should a look of doubt and fear come over the officer\'s face, you are in the right place, but if a look of greed and lust come over the officer\'s face, run out of the station and keep running. You will hear an inhuman sound behind you, like the sound of a rabid dog chasing you, but do not look back, for if you do, the now distorted and gruesome face of the pit fiend the officer has become will send paralyzing fear through your body and you will be caught, raped, and fed upon for the rest of eternity, feeling everything as freshly as the moment it started. Keep running until that sound disappears or until the very act of inhaling feels like it will shred your lungs like so much cheap tissue paper.  You will mercifully pass out.  When you awaken, the officer will be gone and a new one will be in that officer\'s place at the station. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you were in the right place, however, the officer will take you to an elevator. Before the doors open, close your eyes. When you hear a bell, wait 5 seconds, then take 3 steps in. Make a 180 degree spin, and keep your eyes closed. The officer will get on with you and press a button. You will never know what floor you will end up on, so don\'t fret. The same thing will happen over and over. You will be riding on the elevator for hours, going straight down. You will hear a bell and the doors will open. The officer will say, \"Is this where you want to go?\" Do <i>not</i> answer, do <i>not</i> open your eyes. After a while, the officer will sigh and the doors will close. You will go down another floor and a buzz will ring out instead of the bell. The officer will say, \"End of the line.\" Take 7 steps out and wait 30 seconds before opening your eyes. You will be in a long, dark hallway with old white, filth-caked walls. Blood will be oozing upward on the walls. Pay it no heed and walk. Walk swiftly, but don\'t speed walk or run. The demons hiding in the shadows love fast prey, and your scent will slowly drive them wild with hunger. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When you get to the end, there will be a door with no knob. Push it open and you will be standing at the top of an escalator. It seems to go down into endless darkness, but don\'t let your mind waver and don\'t let your bravery falter. You\'ve made it this far; there is no turning back. Should you hear a voice urge you to come down, ride the escalator all the way down. It will take you 7 days.

You will hear loud footsteps behind you, matching your footsteps, sometimes a bit slower, sometimes a bit faster. Do not slow down, do not speed up, do not look behind you, and do not speak. The footsteps will sound like hard sandals hitting metal and you will become very annoyed. Still, keep your pace and do not falter. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After about 20 minutes of walking, you will reach the platform. The footsteps will end and you will feel a presence right behind you.

She will confess her love for you and wrap her arms around you. Ask her again, with sternness in your voice. \"Where do I go?\" If she pulls back and pushes you onto the track, pray that the train comes and takes your life before the woman calls forth her small demons. As small as they may be, they will enter your body and eat you from the inside out. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Should she pull away and cry, caress her cheek and tell her you love her softly. She will begin to tell you in a riddle like manner where the last and strongest Holder is. Ask her this, \"How will I know when it happens?\" When she opens her mouth to answer, the train will come, blowing its horn and awakening all of the demons from your worst nightmares. They will begin stampeding down the escalator, rage flaring in their monstrous eyes. Run as fast as you can to the front car of the train. Those doors will be the only doors that open, and they\'ll open for anyone. The apparition is in the driver\'s seat, looking at you with sadness in her eyes. Don\'t stare into her eyes, for they will enchant you and cause you to forget your mission. The demons will rip you apart slowly and each day, you will heal just for it to happen again. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Reach over the apparition and press the only button.

Once you pull it down, pull it out of the panel and you will see it\'s a dagger. Where the button was in the first control room there will be a heart. Stab the heart and close your eyes. Scream out as loud as you can, \"<i>I fight for the souls that were lost in this trial! This motion is for them</i>!\" Drag the dagger down the heart and a loud screech will be heard. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Your eyes will open and you will be arriving at the station closest to your home.

Try to stay in one position, as too much movement may cause you to be ejected from the tube rather violently into a large toothy maw, which will chew on your body until you are nothing but pulp. If you\'ve exited the correct end, you will fall to the floor of an ornate cathedral of bone, flesh and organs. Eyes of many sizes peer at you from many spots. In the back, the floor arches a bit up and down, the wide rib cage holding back massive lungs and a large heart. Inserted into the back wall is a huge glass jar, suspending a gigantic, pulsating brain in fluids. Its long, thick nerves hang like spider webs all around, stretching to the walls beside it and to the ceiling far above. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Without warning, two very large and very long muscular, skinless arms with clawed fingertips emerge from the walls.

Never quite dead but never quite alive, unable to scream though you want to badly, you will live as one with the living cathedral for all time. The question you must ask before suffering this cruel fate is, \"Why do they despise life?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Without pause, the brain will then open your skull, painlessly. With but a tiny pinch of itself, it will insert a pinch of itself into yours. You will then realize, in the most thorough detail, every bit and piece of what makes life, life.

You will see many dozens of unboundedly fascinating and eye-catching objects, but do not once stop or slow to examine any of them in closer detail, or the group of supposed students who have been following you will take the opportunity to pounce, and you will never see the outside of the walls again. Instead, stay focused on following the attendant. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Eventually, he will lead you to a door and gesture for you to enter. Do so, and it will shut rather gently behind you.

There are no posters on the gray walls, the shelves are devoid of books, and the desks are bare and minimal. A teacher sits at the front desk, wearing a bland gray outfit, grading papers. The combined effect makes you want to drop off to sleep, but be warned - if you do, the nightmare that you enter will never end. Also, do not interrupt the teacher at her work- she feels overworked for her pay already, and if you bother her she may well snap. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Instead, steel yourself and sit down.

Merely keep your gaze directed forward. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Somehow, they all manage to sit down without the teacher noticing, and the lesson begins. It is almost painful in its execution - bare-bones, no-frills teaching. A notebook and pencil have appeared on your desk - quickly begin taking notes, lest the teacher notice and fail you. And you don\'t want to fail this class, believe me. The facts are so stripped-down they hurt, but never once should you halt or interrupt. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After a while, a test will be announced. Accept it. It appears to be written in a language from another planet, and about places and people you don\'t think have ever existed. Keep calm, write from your notes for the first few questions. When you reach question four, lightly tap the kid in front of you on the shoulder. <i>Quietly</i> - you don\'t want the teacher to catch you - ask him, \"When was it meant to happen?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The kid will glance nervously at the teacher, then scribble madly on a piece of paper and pass it back to you. Read it quickly and memorize what it says - the location it details is where the Object is hiding. But the moment you take your eyes off the paper or attempt to move, the teacher will catch you, and all hell will break loose. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The room will suddenly be clothed in the heaviest opulence you have ever seen, and the students and teacher will be revealed in their true forms. These bar description, but know this - they have all the same strengths and weaknesses of the normal human. All across the school, the illusion has been broken, and you\'re going to have to reach the object - wherever it is - before the students manage to take you down. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The gauntlet\'s off now. Use whatever methods available to reach the object - violence, murder, deception, nothing is barred and nothing is sacred. There will be no repercussions, but if there were, they\'d in no way be worse than what will happen should the students bear you to the floor. Make your way to the location, and the Object will be glaringly obvious among the opulence - a plain brown paper package tied with twine, about the size of a large soup can. A thin paper envelope is tied under the string. Grab it, then locate the nearest bathroom. Battle your way into it, then slam the door. It will lock, and hold, but not for long. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Quickly, slip the envelope from the parcel and throw it into the second stall - it doesn\'t matter where it lands as long as it\'s in the walls. The envelope is what draws them, so you want to stall as much as possible. Turn on the hot water in two of the sinks and the cold in the other one. Then, with the door pounding so loud it drills through your head, face the hand-dryers. There\'s three. Take a deep breath, then slam the button on whichever one you like. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Everything will black out for a bit. If you pressed the wrong button, the blackness will lift only for you to experience what the students are about to do to you. It\'s never the same, but it\'s always unbearably painful, and you won\'t stay sane long enough to witness your demise. If you pressed the correct button, however, you will wake up sprawled on the floor of a bus stop half a mile down the road from the limits of the second-largest city you\'ve ever visited. Sit up, rub your eyes. You\'re alone here, and for the moment, safe. Unwrap the package - there\'s a surprising number of layers on it. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Keep unwrapping until you find a layer of green wrapping paper. Stop at this point and look to your left - a cheap lighter is sitting on the bench, along with sufficient bus fare into the city. Grab both, pocket the money, and pile the brown paper and string up. Burn the pile- that last layer of wrapping was there solely to protect the Object from the brown wrapping, and you don\'t want it in existence when you open it finally. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When the pile is nothing but ash, unwrap the final layer and toss it away. You now hold a strange gold-colored D cell battery. Get up quickly - the bus is coming, and you don\'t want to look like a total weirdo by sitting on the floor of the stop rather than the bench. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The battery is Object 80 of 538. It will never run out of power, but if put into any device, that device will never run on any other battery save the gold one. <br><br>'),
(81, 'Holder of Simplicity', 'In any city, in any country, go to any sizable school or university you can find. When you reach the front desk, ask to see \"The Holder of Simplicity\". Should the worker utter a single, piercing shriek, place her hands on her ears and close her eyes, you have come to the right place and should feel free to ask again. But, if she simply ignores you and writes something down, your life is doomed; you will instantly become completely aware of everything that has to happen for each action you make to occur, from stepping on an ant to blinking. After you ask the second time, the worker should instantly calm down and ask you to follow her. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>She will lead you on a roundabout path, heading through the seemingly endless halls of the school. Count the number of right turns you make- after seven right turns, casually slip into the shadows and let the worker continue walking. Should you fail to do this, you will never get another chance to leave, and those endless halls will swallow you up forever. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you succeeded in losing the worker, stick your hands in your pockets and look around for a bulletin board. There will be a morass of colorful announcements tacked to it, with an array of eye-catching pictures and descriptions of incredibly exciting activities. Do not be strayed by these- they are trying to hide the one you are looking for. Look for a plain white sheet of paper almost completely covered by the others. Take note of the room number, then look at the time of the activity it advertises. The date will always be today\'s, but if the time has already passed, then you are too late- they have caught you, and nothing you can do will keep them away. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the time is later than what it is right then, start searching for the classroom. None of the wall-mounted directories are the same, and the numbering system is horribly random. You will likely never find the place, and will be lost searching for it among the endless halls while the hunters circle in. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If by some miracle you do manage to locate the room, ready a weapon and prepare yourself. If you didn\'t make it before the listed time, the door will slam and lock, and nothing will ever convince it to open for you again. If you make it in time, take the door at a run, weapon ready. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>A heavily decorated biology classroom will greet you. The room\'s paint job is disgusting - rancid, vile colors drip freshly slathered from every surface. Posters line the walls, emblazoned with pictures of impossible, unholy creatures. Books in dark, lost languages lie scattered on the floor. Yet the room is empty - almost. At the far end of the room, a student sits hunched over one of the unspeakable creatures from the posters, frantically dissecting it with a long-bladed scalpel. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must ask him the right question, or he will smash the creature aside and turn to find a new subject to dissect - you. At the top of your lungs, scream to him \"Why did it not happen then?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The student will scream, horribly, and whirl around. Time will seem to slow, and in one second he will tell you the hours-long story of why it did not happen then, and all the things that have gone wrong because of it. When he finishes, the creature on the table will whirl up and attack him, tearing him to shreds in seconds. His calculator will fly from the melee - grab it quickly, but dare not to open it. With whatever weapon you have, target the thing\'s head and aim to destroy, or it will do the same to you. Whirl for the door - the rest of the class has arrived. They all brought their dissection kits today, but you\'ve ruined their only subject- and now they want you to replace it. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Battle your way out of that classroom. The topography has changed. Where once endless, grotesquely painted halls stretched, a single, bare concrete walkway stretches across a pit of flames to a steel door. Fight your way over there - do whatever it takes to get through that door. The moment you grab the handle, everything will turn white. Shut your eyes. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Count to five, then open your eyes again. You will be holding the handle of the locker room door at the last school you ever attended. Open it and walk into the locker room. Pull the student\'s calculator from your pocket, turn it on, and press the key labeled \"<i>Entry.</i>\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>A number will appear. Toss away the calculator and find the locker with that number on the door. It will be unlocked - open it. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The whetstone inside is Object 81 of 538. When used on any blade, that blade will never again grow dull, and nothing will be able to resist its bite. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Now take advantage of the locker room\'s showers. You definitely need one after this adventure. <br><br>'),
(82, 'Holder of Purity', 'In any city, in any country, go to any large school or university you can find. Once you locate the visitor\'s desk, walk up to it and ask if \"The Holder of Purity\" showed up for school today. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the worker nods, your fate is sealed - your quest is already known, and nothing you can manage will let you even get as far as the front door. However, if the worker shakes his head and goes back to his work, you are safe. For the moment, anyhow. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Casually sweep your gaze around the school lobby where you stand. No matter how it looked before, it is now beautifully decorated, with delicate draperies over precious, strange stone walls. Look around until you spot a door that stands starkly out among the design - a crudely built door of waterlogged, rotting wood. The handle is rusting away. Bugs unlike any this earth has ever seen crawl through the wood. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Immediately upon seeing the door, every fiber of your person will want to walk away and never look at it again. But if you truly wish to go through with this, you must overcome yourself and walk over to the door. Students, teachers, and staff will try to get your attention, try to get you to do something, anything other than opening that door, but ignore them. Get over there as fast as possible and rip open the door. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You may catch a glimpse of a darkened, twisted shop classroom before something unseen grabs you. The shrieks of the students and faculty are heard as black, grotesque shapes pour out of the room and your unseen captor pulls you in. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You won\'t be able to see anything for about five minutes. Lucky you. A sickly, pale-green light will snap on and reveal your current position - strapped to the table of an enormous black drill press. High, high in the darkness above, a high-pitched, warbling whine is heard. The drill press is on, and your captor from before is slowly lowering it - and the enormous drill bit attached. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Very nearly any noise, any action, will cause your captor to shriek and slam the drill press down, impaling you with the whirling bit. Despite whatever massive damage that might do, you won\'t die - which will only enrage him more. He\'ll rip it back up, move you so that a different part of your body lies under the bit, and slam it back down again. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Only one question will not bring about your endless torture - \"Why did they change?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The lights will snap on, and the drill press will fall silent. Squeeze your eyes shut and do not open them again, for to stare at that corrupted room and its lone occupant for any length of time is to join them. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Your captor will sigh, then give you an answer so simple that it will seem impossible that no-one has figured it out already. You will hear one more quick shift, then the drill press screeching down one last time. No matter your resolve, the pain from this will be unbearable. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Scream and open your eyes. You are lying on a bench on the top level of a parking garage two miles from the school. The part of your body that got hit by the drill press last will still be throbbing with pain and feel swollen beyond belief. Sit up and check the supposed lump- it will come loose from its taped-on fastening and fall to the ground. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The rusted handle from the woodshop door, which you now hold in your hands, is Object 82 of 538. It longs to be back in its proper place, but its destiny draws it to another. <br><br>'),

After locating the front desk, walk up to it and ask to see the one who calls himself \"The Holder of Corruption.\" The attendant behind the desk will look down, then begin to scream. Close your eyes tight, you won\'t want to see what they are doing. When the screaming stops, open your eyes. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You should be in a small, dark room, with wooden walls. There will be a solid looking door of copper and wood behind you. Walk up to the door, knock twice, and open it. You will be standing in the place you call home, but horribly distorted. You will recognize it, but it will be difficult to find your way. Everything will be decayed and rotting. Insects, rats, and all kinds of horrible things wander the house. The house will be buried deep underground, dirt blocks the windows, making it pitch black. You had better have brought a light. If not, the walls won\'t exist, and you\'ll wander for the rest of your existence, in the darkness, unable to die, or to feel weariness. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you did bring a light, however, you are in luck. Quickly find your way to your parents\' room or, if you don\'t live with them anymore, to your own room. On the bed will be a twisted visage of both of your parents, in one body. They will be naked, and smeared in horrible substances, filth, feces, blood, vomit, everything possible. They will be horribly gibbering your name. You cannot react to this at all. If you do, you will join them as one, and your mind and body will break slowly over thousands of years. You will know only torment, and the torment of all others to ever die. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Instead, resolutely stare them in the eyes, and ask them \"Why did this come to pass?\" At this point, they will split into two separate bodies, and tell you from beginning to end, then from end to beginning at the same time, why it came to pass. It will be a horrifying tale, because it will seem it is your fault these things happened. You will most likely go mad from guilt. If you do not, however, the two bodies will produce an hourglass, and place it on the floor. Thank them, and gently pick it up with both hands. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will wake up in the place you call home laying on the floor in the most windowed room. It will be 3:32 in the morning.

Ask him or her, where can you find him, and youâ€™ll be presented with a key, with a number attached to it. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Walk out from the building, into the street, and go north. If the street doesnâ€™t go either north or south, go east, then turn north once you notice a street at your left. Keep walking until you see a hotel. Maybe you\'ve never heard of it, maybe you never realized it was there, but this is your destination. Enter the hotel, speak to no one, and answer no questions asked to you by the employee in the lobby or the guests. Look at the number attached to the key, and find the bedroomâ€™s door where the key belongs. Once you find it, open the door.

Turn off any mobile phones, donâ€™t turn on the TV, and have no objects which can make sounds. Without changing clothes, lay down in the bed, and close your eyes. Even if youâ€™re not sleepy, your mind will drift away, and youâ€™ll be sleeping soon. Think of good things while waiting with your eyes shut, because if fear or bad thoughts emerge, it might be too late.

They will die in horrible, disgusting ways you couldnâ€™t imagine were possible. React no more than what is normal to a human. Go to their funerals, mourn for them. Keep moving with your life. Do not attempt to return to the hotel or back to the asylum, or it will be all over, and you will wish you had died the same way your friends or loved ones did. It would have been less horrifying. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After one week -- seven complete days -- you <i>will</i> see the death of the 3rd person. There will be no way to avoid it. It will be the person you most care for, and no matter how much youâ€™ll try to stay alone that day, the person will still come to you, unaware of his or her fate. It doesnâ€™t matter how he or she appeared, the person will be there.

When all is over, when thereâ€™s nothing left but the mutilated corpse of your loved one, youâ€™ll feel a hand tap your shoulder.

After you are done, there should be a single person waiting there that wasn\'t there before, a sweet looking thing with cold eyes. A definite form is undetermined at this point. Upon talking to him or her, he or she will ask you about these people you have talked to. At every wrong answer, they will make the condition of the person you answered wrong on noticeably worse.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Upon your finishing this quiz, they will open a bathroom door and ask you to join them. The door should lock behind you. The bathroom will be nothing special at the beginning, same florescent lighting, same mirrors, same tiled floor and ceiling. He/she will pull you into a stall and lock it closed. At this point you shouldn\'t say anything if you value your sanity. They will start to talk about the history of the medical practice. In grotesque detail they will tell you about every ailment, every experiment, every person who considered him- or herself a doctor, every tiny adjustment made to a medicine because of the expiration date. This will last for days, so don\'t feel bad about falling asleep; they will simply continue from where they left off when you fell asleep. You may leave the stall, but the bathroom door will remain locked.

You will feel lost in its eye as it gazes at every sin you have ever committed, every travesty, every little bruise and bump. Any reaction that shows weakness will keep your mind, body, and soul tortured throughout eternity. If you waver, you are never leaving that room whole. If you persevere, the bathroom door will open, and you will be free to leave. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you choose the latter phrase, however, you will be rewarded by a visit with any or many other Holders you have encountered in the past. You will find yourself restrained in an old field, its contents dead or dying, and you will be sent through their tortures again and again until death is a happy illusion. After they have had their fill, the Holder of the Second Seed will question you again on any random person in the visiting area. Any wrong answer and the problems of the people in the institution are yours now, but they at least go free. From that point, you will have two more options. The first is to leave and obtain the Object. The other is to be relieved of the illnesses you now have.

The process may drive people madder, but if you are tough enough, you will survive and be healthy again. You will be free to leave. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you chose to obtain the Object, then when you go to bed that night, you will hear a soft word from him/her. When you wake up, you will find a large dark book with instructions on how to grow plants that should have never existed. This Book tells how to grow and cultivate the Seeds of specific plants to breed the First Seed. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>This book is Object 98 of 538. The gathering storm grows with the Seed. <br><br>');

(2538, 'Holder of Legion', 'In any country\'s capital city, go to the building where the country\'s leader works. When inside, locate the visitor\'s desk and ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Legion\". The worker\'s expression will freeze and he will ask you to leave. Do not obey. Instead, keep asking, about once a minute. After some time, maybe minutes, maybe hours, the worker will finally give in. By this time, he will be close to crying, probably even collapsing due to the pressure you\'re putting onto him by the mere mentioning of this Holder\'s name. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Depressed, he will rise and take you into a part of the building that no one else even seems to notice exists. It looks exactly like the rest of the capitol would- in a thousand years. The walls are cracked and sagging, the support pillars are buckled and leaning dangerously, the paint is faded and almost completely peeled off the walls, the pictures are torn, faded, and hanging askew, and the carpet underfoot is rotted and full of bugs. You will be taken deep into these hallways, deep down below the surface. The worker will take you to a door further below than any other in the building, possibly even a hundred meters below the basement. This is where your last chance to turn back is. Should you decide to go into this door, your fate will be sealed, and there will be no chance of ever leaving alive. Turn back if you want to find other Objects. If not...Well, then ask the worker to unlock the door. He will beg you to leave, tears flowing over his cheeks, and he will scream at you if badgered enough. But he should give in if you are determined. He will open the door. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Enter, and it will be closed behind you, and locked. Now there is no turning back, and no matter what you do, you will eventually die. The beings creeping in the shadows of the room have already begun to leech your life from your body and you will feel older with every second. Run as fast as you can to the door on the other side of the room and enter it. The beings here are simply minor demons, not even capable of scaring the smallest child. Follow the red path you see and you will soon reach a wooden door. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Knock thrice. If you are lucky, someone will ask you to stay where you are. Your death will be a quick one. Should he instead tell you to enter, do so. Your feelings do not matter; nothing matters after you have entered this room. Here, you will see them, all behind a kind of force-field that repels anything that gets too close. You will see two thousand of them, precisely two thousand. Or rather: One thousand and nine-hundred and ninety-nine. The last of them is held by the person in the middle of the room. But you will also see things that cannot be described by human words. Things that show that this very room could be a tiny part of hell. Things that might drive you mad if you look at them for too long. Walk closer to the one in the middle, him, her, it. It does not matter what the being there is. Ask him: \"Why do you hide them?\". He will answer you. He will tell you how he got his first one and then proceeded to look for all those others you see around you. The tale might drive you mad, it might kill you, it could do anything to you. But in the case that nothing happens, he will ask you to take his Object. It is attached to his chest, but do not even come close to it. Tell him the following: \"I came to see, not to touch. You may now let me leave.\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will then laugh. He will laugh even worse than the devil, more evil than anything in the world. He will then say a simple sentence. \"Your fate is sealed.\" The Object on his chest will begin to glow and you will feel pain. Then madness. And finally, death. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You have three choices here. One is to accept your fate, and descend to the lowest level of hell for eternity. The second is to kill him, promptly and speedily, but to do so is to take his place as the Holder of Legion, thus rendering your entire quest worthless. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The third is to produce the first Object. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you do, he will scream and attempt to attack you. Do not worry- he can\'t get past the Object. Eventually he will begin to melt, as he dashes himself against the force field generated by the symbol of madness you hold in your hands. Do not open your eyes until no more sound is heard. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Toss the first Object away and look. Where the thing once stood, a single, gigantic diamond lies twinkling on the floor. Grab it. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>It will embed itself in your chest, becoming part of you as much as your heart or your brain. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You are now the final Object of the 2538. Bring them together, and show us your smile. \r\n<br>');
