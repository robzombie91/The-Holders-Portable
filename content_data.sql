(1, 'The Holder of the End', ' In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house in you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of the End\". Should a look of child-like fear come over the workers face, you will then be taken to a cell in the building. It will be in a deep hidden section of the building. All you will hear is the sound of someone talking to themselves echo the halls. It is in a language that you will not understand, but your very soul will feel unspeakable fear. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Should the talking stop at any time, STOP and QUICKLY say aloud \"I\'m just passing through, I wish to talk.\" If you still hear silence, flee. Leave, do not stop for anything, do not go home, don\'t stay at an inn, just keep moving, and sleep where your body drops. You will know in the morning if you\'ve escaped. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the voice in the hall comes back after you utter those words continue on. Upon reaching the cell all you will see is a windowless room with a person in the corner, speaking an unknown language, and cradling something. The person will only respond to one question. \"What happens when they all come together?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The person will then stare into your eyes and answer your question in horrifying detail. Many go mad in that very cell, some disappear soon after the meeting, and a few end their lives. But most do the worst thing, and look upon the object in the person\'s hands. You will want to as well. Be warned that if you do, your death will be one of cruelty and unrelenting horror. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Your death will be in that room, by that person\'s hands. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That object is 1 of 538. They must never come together. Never.'),
(2, 'The Holder of the Beginning', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask the clerk for permission to visit someone who calls herself \"The Holder of the Beginning.\" A small smile will work its way over their mouth, almost as if to say, \"You fool.\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will then be taken down a long hallway -- long enough that you would expect it to lead outside of the building. Yet, in clear violation of the laws of space and physics, it instead leads deep into the heart of the institution. The hall will be forever silent, even if you try to make noise. Screams will die before leaving your mouth, and footsteps will be muffled. In lieu of speech, your guide will simply point to a door.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Beyond it lies a cozy room filled with a pleasant yet unidentifiable perfume. At the room\'s center, a beautiful woman holds her empty arms as if cradling something. This room will remain just as silent as the hallway that led to it, until you ask a singular question: \"Why were they separated?\" The woman will then explain, in excruciating detail, every horrific event in history. Every beating. Every war. Every rape. Every killing. No travesty in the history of the universe will escape your ears. When she finishes, all will fall silent, and you will be free to leave. It is up to you to do what you will with this information.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That woman is Object 2 of 538.

(3, 'The Holder of Eternity', '   In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Eternity\". A sigh might escape the worker as they look upon you with the utmost pity. They will take you down a flight of stairs that you might expect to lead to the basement; they don\'t.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you press deeper and deeper into the underbelly of the institution, you will begin to hear a chorus of screams. At first it will be barely audible, as if originating from a point a great distance away, but as you approach the end of the hallway, the screams will grow clearer and more thunderous, until they drone so loudly as to consume all other noises. The din will quickly become so painful that you will feel the unrelenting urge to claw at your own ears to escape it; resist this impulse. The worker, stoically enduring the cacophony, will show you a door. As swiftly as they can, they will unlock it and run, leaving you alone in this cramped, dark hallway.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This will be your last chance to run. If you decide to continue, open the door; the piercing wail will then end abruptly, leaving your ears ringing. The room you will enter will be coated in an almost tangible darkness that consumes all but the far wall. Manacled to that wall is an emaciated figure covered in raw lashes. He will stare directly at you with a maniacal grin plastered to his face, seemingly undisturbed by his festering wounds and the scalpel rammed into his chest. The only way to save yourself from this man\'s dark designs is to ask, \"Who created them?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will cackle in a manner befitting the death throes of an animal, before responding. His will be the most horrific tale you have ever heard, beyond such primitive concepts as pain and death. It will delve deep into the very essence of evil; those of weak mind would go mad hearing it.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>When he finishes, it will be up to you to release this man from his terrible burden. Remove the scalpel and he will shudder once in agony before falling silent... forever.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That scalpel is Object 3 of 538. It is up to you if the rest should be protected or destroyed. <br><br>'),
(4, 'The Holder of Nothing', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls herself \"The Holder of Nothing.\" Should a look of sheer, primal disgust mar the worker\'s expression, you will then be taken to a separate building, one that appears to be an old, wooden outhouse. Inside will be a seemingly endless corridor that far exceeds the length of that outhouse.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The corridor will be completely silent. Attempting to make any sound at the wrong time is a grievous, lamentable mistake. You will notice the lights in the corridor getting brighter and brighter as you make your way down towards the end; eventually, you will find yourself blinded by their brilliance. If, at any point the lights go out, quickly shout out, \"No! Stop! What you are doing is wrong!\" while backing away. If the lights do not come back on, bolt for the door you came in through. It should still be open; hopefully you aren\'t far enough down the hallway for it to close on you. If it does close, an eternity in Hell would be preferable to what you will suffer.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the lights come back on, continue walking down the corridor. At the end of the hall lies a cell; the worker will open its door for you while glaring at you in disgust. Inside the cell will be a mad pastiche of colors, arranged in several harlequin-like formations. You must not be distracted by them, for at the center of the room is a naked young woman, slathered in blood and bound by strips of human sinew, and you would be better off not knowing what will happen if you take your eyes off of her face for even a moment. Focus on her, and ask: \"What were they when they were one?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>She will look you in the eye and speak the answer in incredible detail. It will be unlike anything you have ever heard, leaving you on the verge of both ecstasy and agony. It is not uncommon for a Seeker to lose themselves in the euphoria. But you mustn\'t let your focus break, and you must take special care not to look upon her tattooed chest. Your mind will tempt you to gaze upon it, but you must resist, for if you fail, she will flay you alive and add your mutilated flesh to her bindings, and you will remain trapped with her, fully conscious, for the rest of time.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That tattoo is Object 4 of 538. They desire to be one again, but they mustn\'t.  <br><br>'),
(5, 'The Holder of Light', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, close your eyes and ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Light\". You will be led to a single door leading to a long, winding hallway, and then told to open your eyes. Open the door. The hallway beyond it will be pitch black, but narrow enough for you to feel the walls with outstretched arms, and guide yourself forward.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If, at any point during your trek down the hall, it is suddenly bathed in light, shut your eyes immediately and quickly make your way back to the door you came in through. If your eyes stay open for more than a second, what you see will force you to instinctively tear them out.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If, on the other hand, the lights stay off long enough for you to navigate the entire corridor, you will reach another door. Look down: if you can see any light escaping from the crack beneath the door, flee immediately, for what you seek is not there. If no light escapes the next room, then carefully turn the doorknob and enter.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The room beyond will be completely dark, aside from a single, dimly-lit candle at its center. The faint light it emits will reveal the outline of a cloaked, motionless figure huddled over it. There is only one question that he will respond to: â€œWhat can protect us from Them?â€ Say anything else, and the man will tear out your eyes, and force you to take his place under the cloak for the rest of eternity.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you ask the proper question, a piercing scream will ring out from the candle, and a series of lights will illuminate the room, revealing images of the most horrifying thoughts, fantasies and memories experienced by sentient minds throughout history. Most people cannot handle this event, turning violently insane or perishing instantly at the sight of such horrors. If you should somehow manage to survive the ordeal, the cloaked man will rise slowly and put his hands to your head, turning your gaze to meet his youthful face.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Stare directly into his empty, gaping eye sockets, for if you look away from that terrible sight, you will be stranded in this room, forever forgotten by time itself. Do not turn to look as he opens your right hand, and places a small, round object upon your palm. As that object touches your hand, you will find yourself able to ignore even the most fearsome agonies -- unless you are in the process of obtaining another Object, for the pains you feel then are far beyond any worldly suffering. Know that even this newfound power will never help you cope with the the horrifying images you have witnessed in that room. They will be burned into your memory for all eternity. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The eye you hold in your hand is Object 5 of 538. The awakening has begun; they must not be brought together. <br><br>'),
(6, 'The Holder of Song', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls herself \"The Holder of Song.â€ You will then be guided to a long staircase that spirals higher than the building stands. At the stairs\' summit is a door.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you open the door, a sudden wave of heat will pour out from the hallway beyond it, and wash over you. Proceed down the hallway. As you walk, the air around you will grow increasingly frigid. When you feel as if you are encased in ice, you must stand perfectly still, remain silent, and listen. If, after a few seconds pass, you hear a baby crying, turn and run. No harm will befall you, but the infant\'s cry will follow you wherever you go. If you hear it for the rest of your life, count yourself lucky; if and when it stops, your firstborn child will die.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you do not hear a baby\'s cry, wait for the hallway to grow warm once more, and then proceed to the door at its end. Enter.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The room beyond will be awash in green light. At its center will be an old woman turning the handle of a silent music box. Her legs have both been severed at the knees. When you speak to her, you must look her in the eyes. She hides a spear fashioned from the bones of her legs; break eye contact, and she will impale you with it and leave you to bleed to death in seemingly unending agony. She will respond to only one question: \"What was the song they used to play?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The old woman will begin to sing in a language not of this world. Her melody will be the most beautiful one you have ever heard, bringing peace and serenity to your mind, body, and soul. You will find yourself vividly imagining a band of carefree children playing and singing, innocent as can be... And within minutes, the scene will eventually take a horribly sinister turn. The children will begin to fight each other, and their conflict will quickly escalate to the most brutal, lethal violence you can conceive of. They will impale each other on wooden poles, disembowel each other with sharp rocks, and even rip flesh from bone with their bare hands. You will witness these children, now merely tattered doppelgangers of themselves, spreading death and destruction more horrific than you could ever imagine on your own. You will see a naked boy, drenched in blood, singing with delight as he runs through a hellish wasteland, pursued by unspeakable monsters. They will overtake him and utterly destroy him, the song still issuing forth from his shredded lips all the while.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>...Yet, inexplicably, you will remain calm and peaceful even as you watch this unspeakable brutality.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>When these horrific visions end, an intense pain will stab at your chest. Your heart will feel like it is about to explode. Do not let the agony break your focus, and do not break eye contact with the old woman, lest you invite a fate so horrible that an exploding heart seems lovely by comparison. If you remain steadfast in your gaze, the pain will eventually cease. The woman will stand up (though, with your eyes still focused on hers, you will know not how) and place the music box in your hands.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The music box is Object 6 of 538. When its song plays again, they will all come together. <br><br>'),
(7, 'The Holder of the Path', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of the Path.\" The worker there will try his best to keep a look of indifference on his face while handing you a key which, as he will explain, belongs to an unused supply closet in the building. If only it were that simple. Upon locating and unlocking the correct door, you will find yourself staring out onto a narrow, winding road suspended in an endless void, the sight only occasionally obstructed by the massive outlines of things best left undescribed.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>To fall off the path is to be thrown out of reality itself. A nightmarish eternity of inconceivable horror awaits anyone who either stumbles into the void by their own error, or is dragged off the path by the timeless monstrosities that reside on the outskirts of creation. If you should ever feel as if you are being watched while traveling through this piece of oblivion, the best chance you have is to immediately freeze in place and hold your breath. Continue to do so until your audience either loses interest, or moves in to claim you. If the latter should occur, feel free to scream as hard as you want, though your screams will fall on deaf ears.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>At the end of the path lies a door that leads to a small, dirt-caked room. Propped up against the room\'s far wall is a heavily emaciated corpse; what\'s left of its skin has long since blackened with necrosis. Approach it and ask one question: \"How did they acquire guardians?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>In response to your query, the \"corpse\" will begin to stir. A subtle red glow will emanate from its eye sockets as it lifts its head and begins to whisper the long and macabre history of the Holders. It will speak of unholy pacts and unspeakable atrocities. Within time, its tale will touch upon every form of evil known to man or God, and a few forms that neither can comprehend. Furthermore, if told the title of any Holder, the corpse will reveal that Holder\'s history and the meaning of the object that it protects. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Well, almost any Holder. The Holder of the Path will never go into detail about itself. This is because the ghoul hopes that you will not question why it seems to be lacking an Object. Truth be told, the ominous glow from within the ghoul\'s eye sockets is actually the shining light of the Object that was somehow sealed inside of its skull.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That is Object 7 of 538. Its Holder will do anything to keep you away from it. <br><br>'),
(8, 'The Holder of Wealth', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Wealth.\" The worker will raise one eyebrow, as if puzzled by your request. Ask a second time, and the worker will shrug and take you across the street, where an opulent mansion awaits. If you are observant by nature, you may notice that the mansion was not there when you started your quest... Its owner would rather you didn\'t think about such things. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Inside the front door will lie a grand staircase, spiraling up across the foyer. The walls will be covered with fine paintings, and a large marble statue will rest on a pedestal by the base of the stairs. The statue\'s eldritch features will evoke an image of a truly horrific beast, at once both alien and evil. Admire it all you want, but don\'t touch it, unless you wish to awaken this starved monster. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Ascend the staircase. As long as you don\'t touch anything, you will be safe. Don\'t panic. At the top of the stairs, you will find a small, wooden door; its plain and unassuming appearance is a sharp contrast to its decadent surroundings. It will open on its own for you, so long as you are not afraid. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Past it, you will see a man with a pointed goatee and short, cropped, gelled hair standing behind a large, mahogany desk. His suit is made of both human flesh and Italian silk. He may speak, and at great length. He will talk about his amazingly beautiful house and the lovely statue of his concubine resting downstairs. Do not interrupt him, and do not answer any questions he may ask. When he is finished, steel yourself and confidently ask, \"May I have my salary?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will proceed to explain to you, in great detail, the value of life. He will talk of things worse than death, and he will tell you exactly what he expects you to do. The fabulous interior of the room will rot away, and the floor will turn from French weave to feces. The man\'s appearance will become cyclopic and unimaginably horrendous. He will fish out a small bank note from the pockets of his human suit, and hand it to you. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That note is Object 8 of 538. Its Holder is counting on you to spend it. <br><br>'),
(9, 'The Holder of Wisdom', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Wisdom.\" The desk clerk will chuckle and guide you to an empty room. They will hand you a key and tell you to wait some time in the room until you hear a bell ring. When it rings, you have to lock the door through which you entered, wait until a second ring, and unlock it. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once those instructions have been carried out, the door will open all by itself and reveal a long hallway, with every conceivable color painted onto the walls, ceiling and floor. Follow the hallway until you hear a little girl singing.  Stop, close your eyes, and stay where you are until the girl finishes the song. If you fail to remain perfectly still, run. Run back to the door through which you came, as fast as you can. Jump through the window of the room where you waited earlier, and you might live. Should you be unable to reach the window in time, you will be dragged back into the hallway by something that is definitely not a little girl. You will be pulled by this horror until time itself ends, forever feeling the pain of every soul dragged to an early grave.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If, on the other hand, you manage to remain perfectly still until the song ceases, you will be free to either turn around and leave forever, or venture further into this realm. If you prefer the latter course of action, walk deeper into the hallway until you reach a human-shaped door. Open it with the same key that was given to you earlier, step inside, and close the door behind you. In the middle of the room, you will see a desk with a bright candle. Behind the desk is a man, whose face isn\'t visible behind the shine of the candle. Approach, but always keep the flame between you and the man\'s face, for if you witness what he looks like, your gaze will be fixed on his until your own hands have removed every inch of skin from your bones.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Stop when you are five steps away from the desk. The man will raise his hand and gesture you to come closer, but do not step any further than this. Close your eyes and ask him one question: \"Who will bring them back together?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will hear the man rise from his chair and begin to pray in a language that you will not understand. After two minutes, you will hear a name.  If you hear \"Anubis\", then you had best utter your own prayers in the short time you will have to do so... but if it is \"Thor\" you hear, then you may open your eyes.  You will see the man\'s severed head lying on his desk, still speaking.  After another three minutes, his prayer will cease, and he will tell you how you will die. He will describe every minute detail of your horrible death, and you will be unable to move or react while he explains your end. Lastly, he will describe the one who will steal your life away from you, and go into such detail as to why it is necessary that you yourself will question which would be worse: you being murdered, or you being allowed to continue to live.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Eventually, the head will finish its ghastly tale. It is object 9 of 538. It is up to you what you do with the knowledge of your death, for now, it is inevitable. <br><br>'),
(10, 'The Holder of Ambition', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit a man who calls himself the \"Holder of Ambition.\" The sound that escapes the mouth of the worker will be so slight, and betray so little reaction, that at first, you may not even be sure your words were heard. All doubt will be settled when they guide you toward a stairwell lit by many windows.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>At the top of these stairs, the worker will leave you to continue your journey alone. You will find yourself standing at the beginning of an eerily calm hallway. Walk to the end.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>In all likelihood, you will encounter a shadow that moves along the wall. Do not follow it, for it is the one thing that will lead you to a place you do not wish to go: a place filled with your silent fears and failures, from which you cannot return. No matter what shape the shadow takes, and no matter how it eases and taunts your dreams with the greatest of your desires and hopes, do not even let it tempt your gaze, let alone your feet.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you make it to the end of the hallway without losing sight of your goal, you will find an open doorway with no locks, bolts, or restraints. A soft light bathes the floor in front of the opening. This is your one and only chance to leave without facing the Holder of Ambition or collecting his Object: if that is the course of action you wish to take, then walk directly back the way you came, without attempting to peek around or into other doors, lest you discover what that seductive shadow hides.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Beyond the doorway lies a room, bathed in an artificial light cast by high windows that cover each wall\'s expanse. At the room\'s center stands a tall, healthy man, standing naked and looking out into the light. His body is covered in uncountable tattoos and scars; only his face is recognizable as unaltered human flesh. You might be tempted to look where he looks, in search of the object of his focus; feel free, but you will see nothing, and learn nothing. The man will not react to anything other than the question, \"What joins them together?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>When asked, he will turn to look you in the eyes. Meet his gaze, but know that if you are not prepared -- if there is even the slightest doubt of your intentions -- then you will lose yourself in his soulless eyes for an eternity. If, on the other hand, your gaze is an honest one, then he will begin to speak in a low voice. His tone will be a comical one, his tale told as if they meant nothing at all, but you must not miss a word, for this story is your preparation. Listen carefully to his tale, and remember every detail.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>When the man finishes speaking, he will bring his hands to his chest, and remove the sutures from one of his more noticeable scars. As the stitches come out, he will bleed profusely and fatally. When the last of his sutures have come out, he will offer them to you, uttering his final words through his own gurgling blood: \"Choosing to seek... leads to an inevitable fate...\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The clump of sutures is object 10 of 538. How you use them depends on what you hear. <br><br>'),
(11, 'The Holder of Life', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of Life\". The worker will try to suppress a groan and you will have to ask again. He will then lead you to an operating room that looks just like any other you might or might not have seen in your life. The worker will give you a scalpel and then leave you alone in the room, locking the door behind him.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will have to wait. Wait for almost an hour. Then the door will open and several people will enter the room, including a pregnant woman. The woman will lie down on the operating table; the other people, who will look like doctors, will prepare everything for the child\'s birth. While they do that, you will be able to ask the woman one question. Ask \"How can they be reassembled?â€ Say nothing else, or the doctors will begin to skin and disassemble you. You will be fully conscious while they do this.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you have asked the right question, the woman will begin to scream, the child is about to be born. You will have to wait until it\'s over, and one of the doctors will give you the child, moving his mouth, but without sound coming from his lips. As soon as he finishes \'talking\' and smiles, you will have to throw the child to the ground and ram the scalpel into its head, or else it will smash your rib-cage and rip your heart out with inhuman strength.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you have thrown the child to the ground in time, it will, despite the scalpel in its head, answer the question you have asked earlier. It will speak with a demonic voice that might drive you mad. While it is talking, the other people in the room will vanish without leaving a trace. After the child finishes talking, it will simply die and the door of the room will unlock. You are now free to go, if you have not been driven mad by the voice.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The dead baby is object 11 of 538. Dare you not remove the scalpel? <br><br>'),
(12, 'The Holder of Catastrophe', 'In any city, in any country, go to any abandoned amusement park you can enter.  Find the largest roller coaster in the park, no matter its condition.  Take a seat on the far left side of the first cart, then close your eyes and whisper \"I wish to see the Holder of Catastrophe.\"  \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will feel the coaster start to move, yet you cannot open your eyes, or you will find yourself moving through an endless void which you will never escape.  The coaster will then slowly start to head up, for what seems to be ages as you listen to the rumbling of the tracks.  You will then hear voices whisper at you and ask you to save them, yet you must not respond to them, or they will take you away to the same void to which they belong.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The voices will stop speaking to you and the cart will come to a stop.  With your eyes still closed, you must grasp the bar in the cart as tightly as you possibly can, or you will be left behind forever.  After you do so, you will feel yourself plummeting straight down at impossible speeds.  The air around you will start to grow cold, and continues as it feels as if you are freezing.  As you sense the cart around you disappear, you must keep hold of the bar, as it is the only thing keeping you attached to reality.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Abruptly you will stop.  Drop the bar, and sit still with your eyes closed until you start to hear the sound of a carnival fanfare in the distance, and only than can you open your eyes, to which you will be greeted by a large pinstriped circus tent a few yards in front of you, surrounded by meadows and happy people, young and old.  You must walk towards the tent, staring at the small entrance which is shrouded by darkness.  As you continue walking, the scenery around you will start morphing.  Slowly the meadow dies, the carnival music slows and bends in pitch until it starts to sound twisted and demonic.  The people decay in the very spots they stand.  They will scream in agony, and ask you to help them, yet you cannot look directly at them, or you will meet the same fate as these illusions.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must continue forward until you finally reach the dark entrance.  Walk forward and allow yourself to be swallowed by the darkness, yet do not stop or look back, as if you do either, you will never find an exit.  Continue your walk into the void until you see a dim light in the distance, and start to hear the sobbing of a man.  Follow these two signs, as you hear the crying of the man growing louder, until you can see the light is coming from a door in the darkness.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>When you walk through the door, you will be greeted by a cold, cement cell. In the far left corner, you will see the crying man dressed as a circus clown, covering his face with a small diary.  You must slowly approach him, as not to aggravate him, until he is right by your feet.  Sit down next to him and ask, \"What do we have to lose?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The clown will then read you an excerpt from the diary through his sobs.  The writings in detail describe the demise of millions of innocents, and the forces that so cruelly and coldly carried out this act.  As he reads, illusions will appear around you, and in the side of your vision you will see every death of every person in the story, many of which were slaughtered, many of which were taken by disease.  However, you must keep looking at the clown, as if you lose sight of him, you will be stuck in this illusion and you will become part of the story yourself.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>After he is done, he will stop crying.  He will lower the book from in front of his face, revealing that he has suffered the same decay as the illusions which you had seen before.  He will hand the book to you, which you must accept.  He warns that you cannot read the diary yourself, or else you will be driven mad.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will then whisper, \"When the stakes are high, best to play the clown,\" as the rest of his body starts to decay, as well as the room around you.  You must close your eyes one more time, keeping hold of the book, and count to exactly twelve seconds before opening them.  When you do, you will find yourself in the same seat of the roller coaster in which you began.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The diary is Object 12 of 538. These events must never be allowed to occur again. <br><br>'),

Keep asking him until he stops denying and withdraws from his counter to guide you through the corridors. As his behavior changes radically, stay on guard, for if you start hearing one single tiny sinister hiss, you should turn around and flee as far as you can, covering your ears, because the time was bad. If you do not escape in time, the faint sound will turn into a dreadful growling, that will soon merge into a continuous shriek of sheer pain, until madness floods you and leaves you to die in a deafening agony.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If the warden remains silent, he will lead you to a closed door with neither handles nor lock. As he pushes it open effortlessly, you will see an ascending winding staircase which canâ€™t possibly lead to any upper floor of the establishment. The door will close behind you and you will not be able to push it back. Past this point, climb and do not turn back, or you will fall into a bottomless pit waiting for living prey to chew upon. Do not count the steps, for knowing how many there are will drive you to insanity. One will then creak, and at that point you should stop. Another door should appear on your left. If it is on your right, then pray for a swift passing.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Enter slowly into the room, and a blinding, obscuring darkness shall descend upon you. You will be required to walk straight forward, for straying even slightly will lead you to be devoured by the roaming and unknown creatures observing you with blinded and purulent eyes. You will know you have arrived when coldness grips you. At that very moment, freeze, or you will die by the hands of the holder who is standing right in front of you. In complete darkness, even closing your eyes will not prevent you from his horrid appearance. It will form into your mind as the most outrageous monster ever conceived, and madness will try to creep into your brain as worms over a decayed corpse. His fulminating breath and constant mumbling would be enough to make you cry, but be advised not to utter anything louder than a weeping, for you might wake what must not be awakened. The only question you will be able to whisper without being torn apart will be \"What do they fear?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will feel movements all around you, as shudders animate your opponents. You will hear what nameless and incurable diseases will strike the world if they were to be frightened, the countless terrors their own fright will unleash on those with a weaker mind than theirs. Amidst the atrocious enumeration of the endless sores the world will suffer, you might hear the simplest, almost ridiculous, yet implacable and certain truth they all fear. Do not move again. When your head is about to implode, it will stop. If you are still able to move, you will find a door in front of you which leads you outside of the ward. There, in the open, in the grass, a broken hourglass will wait for you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You are free to pick it up. It is object 13 of 538.

(14, 'The Holder of the Adversary', 'In any city, in any country, venture across the highways and lonely roads until you reach the city\'s bottom rung. Walk among the ones society has cast away, beggars and poor picked raw by the demands of those better off. Should you come across a scruffy man under a large oak tree holding a bottle of liquor in a paper bag, his shirt sweat-stained and his pants muddied, do not be afraid to ask him if he knows of the one who calls itself \"The Holder of the Adversary\".\r\n<br>\r\n<br>More than likely, he will smile knowingly at you, like an old friend with whom you\'ve just shared an inside joke. Do not be alarmed; the man knows of the one you search for. The less fortunate of us often know things we will never dream of. He will guide you to a manhole and casually slide the metal lid off with one grimy boot. Tossing you a small flashlight which flickers precariously, he will urge you down into the darkness.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once inside the putrid womb of the sewage system, you will come to realize that it bears no unpleasant scent - no scent whatsoever, in fact. But, turning on the flashlight and gazing at your surroundings, you will notice you are in a round room. On all the walls will hang partially decomposed bodies, their owners forever suspended in a state of half-awareness, feeling all the pain and horror of a body withering and rotting around them. Corpses litter the floors, and you may notice that one nearly touches you. Do not shrink back. To show cowardice would invite no creature or entity that you would do well to know. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Once you have observed your surroundings, the smell will arrive. It will be the most awful thing you could imagine: human and animal excrement, sulfur, rotting bodies, burning flesh. You will want to claw your nose from your face, and the watering of your eyes will nearly blind you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>But do not cower, do not run, and resist the urge to vomit. You will find a thought in your head, unbidden: \"We are the remains of the ones who could not face the Adversary.\" There is no source of this whisper, though it may curl around you as if carried by the stench itself. Suddenly, the bodies will rupture and burst, one by one, releasing more of the horrible stench and bathing you in rotted bodily fluids and slimy chunks of human refuse.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The corpses then will sink to the floor, and what rises from the slurry is a creature of pure beauty. Man, woman, or something else entirely - it depends on you yourself. It will not be possible to shake your gaze from this gorgeous, naked human until you realize the creature is an idealized caricature of you. Confident, heart-achingly gorgeous, smiling a gentle, patient smile, It will be everything you yourself could ever desire to become.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will be overcome by a sudden jealousy, a total anger, a need to annihilate this perfect you. Do not give in, no matter how strong the temptation. If you do, you are doomed to the Adversary\'s wrath - the eternal torment of the Damned you have witnessed prior. There is only one question you must ask the exquisite creature: \"What could they destroy?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The Holder of the Adversary will laugh at you melodically, condescendingly, and will explain to you as though you are a small, stupid child exactly the answer to your question. It will spare you no details, even the most horrific. Though horrifying, the story will be interesting and calming to listen to, and you will find yourself absorbed in a childlike fascination with The Holder. You may liken its story to one told to you by a loved one or a guide when you were a child, and you will know that you now have the key to defeating the Adversary - that which the Damned could not acquire. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>At the end of the story, The Holder will ask, smiling pleasantly, \"What will you do now, my child?\" If it asks you anything else, or tells you something different, your fate is sealed, and when you eventually emerge from the sewer, the ragged people you have encountered will descend upon you like ravenous animals, and tear you apart with tooth and nail, feeding on your body. There is no escape, only the knowledge that it <i>will</i> happen.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Regardless of your fate, The Holder will place an Object in your palm and close your hand around it. \"You mustn\'t open your hand until you are free of this place,\" it will say, as a fitting good-bye.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Now you must turn and leave, and do not look back. Once you escape the sewer, and if you are lucky, you may open your fingers. What you will find there is a green plastic army man toy.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>That toy is Object 14 of 538.

Don\'t ask any questions, because he won\'t speak to you, and in the case that he does, you will wish he hadn\'t. He will take you down a long hallway and you will walk with him for what will seem like hours. Stare straight ahead the entire time, for if you look at the floor, walls, or ceiling of the hallway, you will run into a dead end and the worker will pursue you with a hellish bloodlust until you are completely disemboweled.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>After exactly 350 paces the worker will stop, turn around, and pull a watch out of his pocket. He will turn the dial backward one hour and at that point, you will have one hour to complete your task. If you don\'t, then there are no words to describe your fate. The lights will go out for exactly 3 seconds, and when they turn back on, you will be in a room with no doors and a red-tinted skylight shaped like a pentagram. This will cast a blood-red star in the middle of the room where a splintered cherry table with two seats will be. Sitting at the seat closest to you, look up. Look down again, and a man with long, dirty black hair will be face-down on the table. He will answer to one question: \"Where did He once stand?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The man will speak not of a place that exists on any map, but will describe the room in painfully grotesque detail.

When you reach the front desk, ask to see someone who calls himself the \"Holder of the Future\". Do not follow if the attendant offers to show you the way; he is not the true guide, and will lead you into madness. The true guide will fall silent and hand you a sheet of paper on which the way forward is written in lines of blood and fire. Walk forward, concentrating on the writing. If your focus doesn\'t waver, you will pass through both desk and man to find yourself in a long, disused hallway. It may once have seemed opulent, full of color and promise, but the walls are now stained and the carpet is black and filthy. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you pass through the hall images will flicker in previously-unseen windows. It may seem that, from the corner of your eye, you see friends long-dead beckon to you, or lost lovers turned young and new once more as they offer themselves to you again. Voices seem to whisper that the windows hold second chances, opportunities to make things right. You can choose again, they seem to say, but you mustn\'t look up from the paper in your hands. To do so is to glimpse fully what watches you from outside, and that would leave you at an end truly beyond salvation. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Accounts differ as to the hallway\'s ultimate, impossible length. Some say that you must continue to walk until you have glimpsed each of all your possible futures through the windows. Others imply that the closer the time of uniting approaches, the shorter one will find the journey to the end of the hall. If the latter is true, may all who enter find their path long beyond reckoning.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You may only look fully away from the paper at the end of the hallway, and even there you may never look behind you. The door before you leads into a ballroom that, like the hallway, has fallen from its former bright elegance into filth and despair. Move forwards into the gloom until the door and all chance of escape are lost behind you. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Walk with care. The Holder watches you even now. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The path forward once passed straight through the center of the room, but the center has not held over the many years, and the way has...drifted. You may never find your way if it has drifted too far, and you will spend the rest of your unnaturally long life wishing you had given yourself to the windows\' half-glimpsed temptations. If you are fortunate, however, you will find a single point where the little light remaining fades away completely, and there you must close your eyes and wait, regardless of what should happen next. If you have pleased the Holder, you will come to hear a cat\'s soft purr, and you will feel its warmth twining around your feet.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must keep your eyes closed until a voice has asked you \"What will you do with them?\" three times. To answer the first or second time will turn the purrs to snarls as the touch of a thousand razored claws pricks your throat. Only after the third and final time may you open your eyes.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>In front of you will be a woman lying on a bed. As with the rooms that preceded her chamber she might long ago have been stunningly beautiful, and though she lies naked on her bed she is nauseatingly fat, her skin pockmarked with bedsores and dead flesh and syphilitic blooms. Hundreds of cats cluster around her; eventually one will come to stand expectant at your feet. Speak only to this one, telling him \"I will do what I must\". \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will then teach you the language of the cats, and once you have learned the others will tell you a secret that was never meant for human ears.

As you get closer you see that the tree is constructed out of bones and it is surrounded in a pool of blood.

Drink from the vial and you find yourself standing in the lobby of the hospital.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This vial is Object 22 of 538. The hour is nigh and the demons are calling. <br><br>'),

Should you gaze out of this window your eyes will soon burst from your sockets and your screams will be your only utterance for all eternity. The room is small, the walls covered in blood, and a small cloaked figure sits in the middle. It will respond to only one question: \"Why do they hate?\" The figure\'s cloak will fly into the air revealing a grotesquely disfigured being. It will answer your question in horrific detail. Upon finishing the story it will collapse, as if a tremendous burden has passed from its shoulders, and crawl into the corner. You will begin to hear strange, unearthly shrieks from beyond the door.

You must wait precisely eight seconds before taking it, or the colors themselves will deny you, and you may not enter.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The warden will stand and lead you to a cell, opening the door for you and motioning for you to enter.  Inside the cell you will find two little boys, both garbed in shades of grey, and their skin and hair will appear as if all the color was drained out of them.  One has long hair and wears a white dress, while the other wears a black suit and has hair cut short.  Only look into the white one\'s eyes, for they are normal, and the eyes of the black-clothed boy will lead you into madness.  Each will wear one glove and hold out both their hands to you.  Take only the gloved hand of each, for should you touch the black-clothed boy\'s flesh, you will be plagued with the worst agony in all the universe but you will not die and he will not let go. Should you touch the white-clothed boy\'s flesh, you will feel more pleasure than you have ever experienced, but he will soon pull his hand away, and you will never feel that pleasure again, no matter how you yearn for it; your lust will kill you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The boys will look at each other and nod once; should they shake their heads, close your eyes and quickly say, \"I am not what you seek, but I can change the tides.\"  Once you say this, they will both giggle and pull on your hands, opening a trap door in their cell and descending into darkness.  The boys will speak in unison, endlessly bragging about their riches, all the things they have. They will ask you many times if you are jealous; each time you must simply answer \"Yes.\"  Your fate now lies in the hands of these boys.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The stairs you descend are long, and grow ever narrower, until finally one boy will go in front and one in back.  Should the boy in black go in front, consider yourself lucky; life now is at your back.

They will stare after you, tears streaming down their faces, and tell you they can go no further, but point to the door.  You must enter.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The room is pitch black, save for a single beam of light at its direct center.  Standing in the light is a woman, much like the boys, completely stripped of color.  Her hair and gown both reach the earth, each as white as her flesh.  Her eyes are only whites, staring blankly at you.  If she should smile at you, you have amused her, and she will light up the entire room with her light and you will become one of the writhing bodies that makes up the collection beneath her glass floor.  Should she frown at you, she will turn her back and light up the part of the room behind her, awakening seven other beings: a cackling man who wears just black, a weeping man garbed in white, a snarling man with piercing red eyes, a grimacing woman who wears only pink petals, an emotionless girl enveloped in green, a sickly man with silver hair, and a smirking gentleman covered in riches.  They are to be your judges.  You must the pick the one that you feel will do you justice and walk towards them, asking along your way, \"When will they strip you of this earth?\"  Should you choose the wrong color, the one you have chosen will stand very still and smile at you eerily, and you will soon feel yourself slipping away into nothingness.  Should you have chosen the correct color, they will respond with a hideous screech, pointing fearfully at the woman in the center of the room.  The others will scream curses at you in many different languages and you will feel piercing pain rip through your body.  Soon, the one you have chosen will step forward to embrace you, and whisper in your ear their sickening tales, the stories of your demise, of the demise of the world when every breath will fade away.  Do not move.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The curses will stop and the room will be lit, the seven all staring at you.  Where the woman was there will now be a small feather, like that of a dove, changing its color continuously.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This feather is object 24 of 538.

Strewn across the entirety of this room are the bodies of the stillborn and the fetuses of the unborn.

Closer examination of the suckling infant will leave you pondering its true age.  Its expression seems weathered and careworn, an eternal, knowing glance assuring you that its eyes have forgotten more than most will ever see.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Approach the mother, calmly.  Should you startle her and interrupt the feeding, your only hope is to whisper, \"I wish not to disturb you, nor your beautiful son.\"  If you have appeased her, position yourself so as to gaze directly into the child\'s eyes.  Once there, you must not break eye contact for fear of upsetting the infant and bringing about your own doom. You may ask him one question and one question only: \"For what have we been created?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The baby will move and wrap his tattered cloth around you, binding you and rending you limb from limb, yet you must not react to the pain or risk never returning to your original form.

The truth of the origin of the Seekers will be brought to life, and if you\'re not driven insane by this truth, you will feel the warmth of this knowledge glowing inside you. This heat will grow until the pain of the burn outweighs that of your torn flesh a thousandfold.  You will feel your body melt away, burning into nothing save ash.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>At the peak of your anguish, if you have managed to remain stoic, you will blink the eyelids which you no longer have, opening them to find you have returned outside, exactly one day before the incident. In your hands you will find a tattered manuscript, the text of which seems to predate existence.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>This Object is 25 out of 538.

He didn\'t expect this ridiculous ritual to work at all, but after all, the only thing he had at risk was about an hour\'s wasted time and maybe a little embarrassment. He approached the woman working at the reception desk and asked in a quiet whisper if he could visit the one who called himself \"The Holder of Perspective.\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>What happened next surprised him a little: the receptionist nodded her head solemnly, just as the instructions said she would. \"Okay,\" he thought. \"Apparently  I\'m not the first one to pull something like this. Chances are she\'s read these things and is just playing along.

God, why did I think this had the slightest chance of working?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>His rambling, self-deriding thoughts were silenced, however, once she unlocked the chained double doors and he saw the long, narrow stairs leading up far higher than the building should have physically allowed.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\"Holy shit, these things are actually real.\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>James ascended the stairs with caution. As expected, once he reached a certain height, he began to see images projected onto the walls. They were the largest and deadliest disasters of humankind; the destruction of Pompeii, the ravages of the Black Plague, the Holocaust, 9/11. The images showed these tragedies through the eyes of each and every victim. It was all James could do to prevent being consumed by sorrow and grief, but he knew well the price for letting himself succumb to despair. Besides, beyond his wildest expectations he\'d already made it this far; he couldn\'t let himself fail now.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>After a long and tiring climb, he finally made it to the top of the stairs where an ornate marble wall with several tiny, eye-shaped glass windows awaited. He remembered his instructions and put his left eye into the window with a perfect vertical crack down the middle. In an instant his viewpoint shifted from his own body to that of an ancient man in a oval stone chamber. The man was using his slender, bony fingers to trace patterns over a large glass eye. James felt his grasp on his own mind weakening, so before he lost his mind completely, he thought as hard as he could, \"How will They see the End?\"\r\n<br>\r\n<br>In an instant, thousands of images started flashing before his eyes. They were images of the same scenes he\'d viewed in the hall, only this time they were from the eyes of outside observers. Feelings of apathy, grief, and joy flooded him all at once. The last image he saw was of an endless inferno; at this, there was no emotion other than sheer unbridled horror. Already physically and mentally drained from the journey up to this point, James could no longer handle the strain and collapsed where he stood.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>---------\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Ah, another poor Seeker who couldn\'t handle my visions. Very few have the mental strength for it, you see, and for good reason; no ordinary person was ever meant to witness the vision of the End, and certainly not an amateur like that one.

If at any time you begin to feel fear, get up and leave. You are still free to escape. If you choose to stay, you must sit and wait until the lights in the room flicker. Do not stand. Do not get up. If you are not sitting down when the lights flicker, then you will plummet into the void between worlds, a meal for its grotesque denizens. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When the lights flicker, you must shut your eyes immediately. Gazing upon the void will destroy your mind. Only when you hear a man clear his throat may you open your eyes. You will be in a dark dungeon, bound to the chair by a web of ebony chains. Surrounding you will be heads impaled upon blood-soaked pikes, and standing before you will be a man wearing an executioner\'s uniform. Stare him in the eyes; do not move your gaze and do not show even the slightest tinge of fear, for if you do, he will add your head to his collection. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The only thing you may speak without being beheaded is the question, \"What will they bring?\" The executioner will laugh an inhuman laugh, and then the impaled heads will begin to speak. They will speak of horrors, of executions, of their individual ends, but you must not move your gaze from the executioner, or you too will be speaking of your death. Eventually, he will speak of his own end, of what they brought to him. When he finishes, he will remove his cowl, revealing a skeleton\'s face. With a cackle, he will wave his hands, and the world will plunge into darkness. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When the light returns, you will be sitting peacefully in the lobby of the institution. In your lap will be the executioner\'s cowl. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That cowl is Object 34 out of 538. You have seen what they bring; will you stop them? <br><br>'),

If you do, you will immediately hit the spike-ridden bottom of the pit and meet a gruesome death. If you remain resolute, your fall will eventually slow and stop, leaving you in a room soaked in darkness. Into the darkness, you must speak only one thing: \"What is their weapon?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Immediately the room will be illuminated. Surrounding you will be everything that you fear, and in the center will be a creature who will take the appearance of your greatest fear. Not even once can you flinch or shrink away from this creature, or it will dismember you in the most painful way possible. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must stare at your greatest fear while it tells you its story in excruciating detail. It will tell you of all the fears in the world, from the tiniest to the greatest, in all of their horribleness. When it is finished, the creature will ask what you fear. Now you must confess all of your fears to the creature, without looking around the room. If you miss even one, you will be consumed by your own terror, leaving nothing but a shell remaining. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you confess all of your fears, the creature will scream, and the scream will send you hurtling through the wall behind you. When you stop moving, you will be across from the closet you entered earlier, and in the closet will be a mirror. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>That mirror is Object 35 of 583.

He will lead you inside and lock you there. The door will not open, and it will be pitch black.

The worker will motion to the end of the hallway, and promptly leave you without a word. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You must walk to the end of the hallway, without speaking a word. Once you reach the end, place your hands upon the wall to reveal that it is an illusion which you may walk through. If you are scared, or unsure of what is behind the wall when you step through, or have any doubts at all, you will simply walk off of the plane of existence forever, never to be heard from again. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>But if you believe in yourself, and believe answers lie beyond the wall, when you step through you will appear in a bright white room with many paths.

It appears to be everything, and nothing. Equals and opposites are meaningless in this room. It is said that most who enter are driven to a maddening insanity and begin to claw their own flesh off, or disembowel themselves with their bare hands, all while laughing manically. Never dying, this will be their fate for eternity. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Should you manage to not be driven to insanity, you will notice a nondescript figure standing in the center of the madness. It appears to be human, yet at the same time, something much more hellish. You will not be able to comprehend this entity visually, but you must not repulse at its sight, nor can you say anything to it. It will begin to speak to you many events. Some of which you know are true. Others you know are lies. Some which you are unsure of. The entity will become increasingly agitated that you are ignoring its nonsense. You MUST refrain from saying anything at all, until the entity falls silent briefly, and then asks: \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\"What would you do, if they were all brought together?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>To this, you must very firmly reply: \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\"Everything that you would do.

He does not like slackers, so quickly ask him your question. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The only one he will respond to is: \"Where do I go, Sir?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will tell you. He will tell you in such detail, such <i>horrifying</i> detail, that you will be tempted to strangle him. Do <i>not</i> try it- he is a far more experienced fighter than you could ever hope to be, and should you break salute, you will meet an extremely messy demise. When he is done, he will say \"at ease\", and hand you his pistol. This is your cue to drop salute. Take the sidearm and put it in your holster- if you did not have one before, you do now. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>An explosion will suddenly decimate the far wall and atomize the general. Through the hole you will see, on the horizon, the long, thin shape of a missile rising. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Shut your eyes tight and open them for nothing. The sounds of horrid battle will fade away until, out of the silence, a single gunshot rings out. Open your eyes. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You are standing in the middle of a field of waving wheat. Somehow, you know that this is where the horrific battle you walked through will take place. And you also know, somehow, that you will be in the general\'s place. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The pistol he handed you is Object 44 of 538. Learn how to use it- it has one magazine left. If you fire the last shot at the right time, you will avoid the fate of the general. If not, you will join him.\r\n<br>'),
(45, 'Holder of Peace', 'In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway house you can get yourself to. Storm up to the front desk with a look of rage on your face, and demand to see a person who calls themselves \"The Holder of Peace\" immediately. The attendant will recoil, and ask you to speak softly. Do not comply with his request- if anything; speak louder- for the anger in your voice is all that keeps the chains locked on the door behind the desk.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>Keep the anger in your voice- the attendant will duck under his desk and point with a quivering finger down a hall to the right that was not there before. Immediately turn and stomp off down the hall. Do not look over your shoulder, for should the attendant catch you- and he will- he will casually lean back and flip the lock off the door behind him. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Walk until you find a door with a beautiful mother-of-pearl inlay design. Throw it open, but take the rage off your face <i>immediately</i>- the ones inside do not appreciate such anger. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>With a peaceful look across your face, enter. You are in a beautiful, open-aired temple, with ivy curling up the marble pillars and beautiful mosaics embroidering the walls. The door will lock behind you. Do not try to open it, for it never will, and the monks in brown robes you see wandering about will do anything to get you to stay- even if it means your death. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Wander around. No matter what language you speak, the monks speak it too. They\'re friendly, and all of them would love to chat, but politely decline. Tell them you must speak with the Head of the Order. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Eventually you will be directed to a man sitting at a chessboard - the temple\'s abbot. The figure across from him is hooded and wearing armor. Do not attempt to speak to the hooded figure, or your death will be far worse than any vision of hell that man could conjure up. Instead, turn to the man in the now-familiar brown robes. The game is one move away from checkmate. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Bow, and ask nicely, \"Why do they gather, Father?\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will open his mouth as if to speak. But the figure across from him will let out a demonic howl of rage and draw a sword. It is beautifully crafted, but seems somehow stained with an unthinkable evil. With a yell, the figure will kick you down and begin systematically slaughtering the other monks. They will try to fight back, but they have only staves, and the sword the madman wields is so sharp that it slices through the pillars like a knife through butter. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>As you are watching this, the abbot will make the final move in the game. The man in armor will swing around, and then run at you with the sword upraised. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you were rude or did something wrong, you will be rent at the atomic level by the blade of the sword, and the pain will never cease. However, if you were polite, the abbot will step in front of you and jam the black king into the right eye of the warrior. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Pay no heed or sympathy as he falls to the ground, screaming, or the abbot will whirl around and do the same to you with the white king. Instead, focus on the abbot, who has now turned around to face you. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will tell you why they gather. It is a long tale, so fraught with bloodshed and horror that it may well snap your mind. But if you survive its telling, he will reach under the table with the chessboard and pass you a scabbard richly jeweled and inlaid with gold. Though you have never seen it before, you instinctively know that it matches the sword the warrior was wielding a moment ago. Do not hesitate- take it, walk over, pick up the madman\'s sword, wipe it, and sheath it. Buckle it on as well- you will have need of it. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Move to leave, but before you do, the good Father will halt you and gesture towards the, now un-hooded, face of the warrior. He was handsome, but pay no heed to that. The one thing you should be focusing on is the fact that the black king is gone. Look up at the abbot, who will nod and say one word: \"Regicide\". \r\n<br>\r\n<br>A flash of light will blind you, and when your sight returns you will be standing on the curb two blocks down from the asylum. Step back onto the sidewalk- you don\'t want to have an accident. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The sword you now wield once belonged to the white king, and is Object number 45 of 538. The Black King is running from the scene of his murder, and the White King\'s sword longs for vengeance.\r\n<br>'),
(46, 'Holder of the Mirror', 'In any city, in any country in the world, go to any mental institution or hospital, and ask the attendant for the \"Holder of the Mirror\". The attendant will look at you strangely, as if you had spoken in a different language. Ask again, until they finally understand, and they will lead you deep into the institution without a word. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>They will lead you to a plain iron door, unlocking it and motioning for you to enter the dark hallway beyond. They will stay behind, never uttering a word, never making eye contact with you. Once the door closes behind you the hallway will be lit by an ethereal light, to reveal the walls of the hallway made of mirrors. The reflections stretch out to infinity on either side of you, but none of them show your reflection; they show the reflection of those who came before you. Each reflection shows another who sought the Holder, each shows how they died. Try not to look at their faces as the beasts devour them; try not to look at all, just walk in a straight line. If you look, if you watch, the beasts in the reflections will see you, too, and they will come for you. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If ever the light begins to dim, if you begin to lose your way in the darkness, close your eyes tight and say firmly, without fear, \"The ones you seek have gone before\". If the lights return, you are lucky, and the creatures that stalk you have let you alone. If it goes dark, do not run. There is no point in fleeing, nor in praying for a swift death. They will catch you, and your end will stretch out to eternity. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>At the end of the impossibly long corridor, you will find another door, with hot white light shining around its edges. Knock on the door, and you will be allowed entry. Standing in the center of the octagonal room will be a figure, merely a silhouette in the half-light of the chamber. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will pay you no heed, until you ask him the question, \"What do they reflect?â€ Any other question, and he will fill your every pore with a thousand needles, flaying your hide and letting it fly in salt winds as he tortures your mind into insanity, ensuring you live eternally with him in the chamber, merely a shade of what you once were, every moment of existence a mad agony. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you ask him the right question, however, he will answer you, in details that will chill you to your bones and turn your heart to stone. He will tell you what the Holders mean, why they exist, and what is to come. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After he tells you this, he will step into your vision, revealing who he is. You will see yourself, except instead of eyes your copy will have shining silver mirrors in its sockets. As you watch, unable to move in horror, your copy will dig one of the mirrors out, blood spilling thick and fast. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will hand yourself the bloodied shard, and then you will find yourself back, outside the institution. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>This bloodied mirror is Object 46 of 538. \r\n<br>Do not attempt to clean the Blood from its surface, or your end shall be a Nightmare beyond even the Horrors of Hell.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>It will reflect what has been, and what is to come. <br><br>'),

The objects you have are yours no longer, and their Holders will want them back.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>In your dream you will see a beautiful garden, with cool fountains and rare flowers sparkling in the mist. Here you may rest and prepare yourself. When you are ready, search the garden until you come upon a gazebo in the middle of a clearing. In the gazebo\'s shade rests a beautiful woman in a dress that echos the colors of the garden. She will gesture for you to sit on her left; she likes you and she has a task for you to complete for her. Without words or gestures, she will ask you to find her a flower in her garden. It\'s best to do as she asks; you are, after all,she is your friend and it best to be in her graces.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>She will keep the description of the flower a secret; she is testing you, after all. If you are destined for your role, or if your luck continues, you will come upon two interwoven trees, each producing a different flower. Choose wisely, for if you displease your hostess it would be more advisable to smash your skull upon the rocks than to face her discontent. If you choose the right flower, then simply head back to the gazebo and give it to her. She will smile, kiss you on the cheek and say, \"I was a Seeker once, too; be aware of your fate.â€ As she turns away, you will see her back has been mauled and mutilated by fire, teeth, and things your mind couldn\'t hope to comprehend. Follow her into her home. Do not be afraid; she wishes you no harm, as she understands your journey. You will stop at the entrance of the house, and she will open the door for you with these final words: \"I will let you go freely, but you must promise me one thing: if ever your journey brings you back here, I ask that you end me. If you break my promise, sleep will never hold safety for you again.\" With that, she will gently push you through the door and back to the realm of the waking. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will awaken in your own bed. Through the corner of your eye you will see  something being slipped under the door. It is an envelope containing a single flower petal.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The petal is Object 47 of 538.

When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of the Sacrifice\". A look of bliss should then come over the worker\'s face, and they will ignore you. Request twice more. You will then be taken by another staff member to the highest floor in the building, then one higher. It will be in an unused, pitch-black section of the building. It will appear as if it is under construction. If you hear the sounds of work being done, demand that you be taken to the overseer. The staff member will realize he has not fooled you and will take you to the true floor. You will hear an unending groaning reverberate off of the walls from the area furthest from you. It is of utmost importance that you listen to where the sound echoes from. Should the source of the noise change, stand still for 5 seconds and extend your right arm, displaying your palm towards the darkness. If you feel what seems to be thousands of the most wretched bugs in existence crawl across your arm, do not flinch, do not cry out. If you do either, there is nothing that will save you. If the feeling ceases, then proceed further. Upon reaching the end of the hall, something will trigger the lights.

When you reach the front desk, ask to visit someone who calls himself \"The Holder of the Grail.\" As soon as your words reach her ears, the worker will suddenly have a blank stare on her face. If you stare at her, you may suddenly lose all grasp of reality. You should avert your gaze, and ask your question again. A blunt object will smash into your head from behind, and all will go black. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When you wake up, you\'ll be in a dark room. A compass stands on a pedestal in the middle, pointing out the four directions for all eternity. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you go south, you\'ll find a well. If you look inside the well, a stream of demons will emerge and eat you. This is far worse than it sounds, as your consciousness does not vanish, and you will have the experience of being digested in fifty different places for countless millennia.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you go east you will wander the land of Nod for all time.

If you still wish to seek me, be advised you cannot make this journey more than once. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You will go to any morgue in any city, state or country. Ask any mortician there to see the most current \"customer\". Should a look of disgust and disbelief come over him, thank him for his time, take a bow, turn around, and walk, do not run, walk calmly out of there. I know your time as I know everyone\'s and it has not come yet. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Should a look of understanding come over him, he will leave the room and return with a large French chef\'s knife, two surgical needles with thread, and a gold bar. He will also roll in a fresh body and a medical book. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Put down the needle on the roller, stab the knife over the body\'s head, and stand facing the top of the body with the bar in your hand, (do whatever with the book, only a book). You must wait until the mortician leaves the room, (which will be quite a long while). Before he leaves, he will state the scientific name of a location in the body and will take his leave. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Stand until the mortician leaves the room, and do nothing until he does. When he leaves, look in the book for the name of that place in the body, and use the knife to split that part of the body open. Place the gold bar in that part, and thread it up. Only one of the needles will completely remove the scar, so choose wisely. Do all this while holding a stoic expression on your face. After you have completed your task, the room will go dark, and you must yell in a clear voice, \"See? I have prepared a gift for you, take what is yours.\" I will then appear in all my unearthly glory, and judge. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you had a reaction from anytime the mortician left the room up until the lights went dark, or the scar remains, your soul will be mine to take as well as the gift, and you will both be taken to my lair. If your face was stoic throughout, and if the scar healed, I will unwrap my present with my great Scythe, searching for the bar. Remain with a lack of expression on your face, or I will decapitate you, not so bad an end as to others in this journey. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When I find it, I will Smile. And when I Smile, a bright light will flash, and the room will reappear, shockingly different. I describe to prepare you. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The room will be constructed out of dead children and toddlers, their eyes gone, and blood ebbing out of their mouths. They will be cemented together with a black substance slowly enveloping them. They will writhe, and cry for their mommy and daddy, blood will replace their tears. You cannot close your eyes, or show emotion, lest I judge you to be unworthy, and will take you to Tartarus. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>There will be one baby in front of you, dead, normal, with a scalpel in its head, perhaps you will recognize it... \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After half a minute of this horror, if you remained sane, it will be time for the third test. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>A dark, twisted version of this world shall appear, inhabited by the damned. Where we appear, there will be a strange, smooth stone field, with one 3-foot pillar in the center. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>I shall reappear, and throw you a wicked, dark knife, carved with symbols. You must stab the end of your forefinger with it. You will feel unbearable pain in your finger, but be pleased that I have lessened the pain for you, otherwise you would have had pain throughout your body. You must bear the pain however, and though the blood will not clot the finger, you will not run out of blood, for you are in my realm. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>After which, you must draw me a pentagram, 6 feet circumference, with the tip of the star pointing me. Make sure it is good, I am a ruthless judge. (You are allowed to plan and measure.) \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When you are done, I shall look upon it. One of two things will happen. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>One: I turn and close my eyes in disgust; if this happens, the pentagram will catch ablaze. As your blood on the ground burns, so shall the remaining blood in your body. Your veins shall burn for all eternity, in the center of the pentagram, the pain never leaving. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Two: I like your art, and Smile. I will turn to you and Smile. My eyes will blacken, dark, shadowy tendrils will come from my mouth, and form a hellish grin. You will realise that the same is happening to you, and that I have just infected you with my Disease. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>When the blackening will cease to flow from your body, it will have turned night; stare only at the pentagram. A demonic audience is watching you, and they tend to rip people to shreds if they look at them, so keep your gaze fixed upon the pentagram. They will dance around you in a devilish flurry, taunting you, mocking you, spitting on you and the like. If you remain stoic, then they will leave. After they have all left, the blackening will return, and ignite a random number of candles around the pentagram. Count and remember this number; it will serve you well at The End. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The light will return and you will awaken outside of the morgue, around mid-day. The cut on your finger will have healed, and it will the exact number of candles that will dictate how many days have gone by. You will notice a dark ooze on the ground in front of your face, and sticking in your clothes. The Blackening has followed you. You now hold the power to summon the Blackening within you at will, the same you saw in my face during the third test. The ones who gaze at your face when it appears will slowly be consumed by the Blackening, the Disease. Every time you summon the Blackening, you will feel the pain you felt on your finger, over your whole body, increased tenfold. You will not pass out, but the pain will be unbearable. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The Disease is object 50 of 538. With it, you can Blacken anyone, even the immortal... <br><br>'),

Instead, keep asking, about once a minute. After some time, maybe minutes, maybe hours, the worker will finally give in. By this time, he will be close to crying, probably even collapsing due to the pressure you\'re putting onto him by the mere mentioning of this Holder\'s name. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Depressed, he will rise and take you into a part of the building that no one else even seems to notice exists. It looks exactly like the rest of the capitol would- in a thousand years. The walls are cracked and sagging, the support pillars are buckled and leaning dangerously, the paint is faded and almost completely peeled off the walls, the pictures are torn, faded, and hanging askew, and the carpet underfoot is rotted and full of bugs. You will be taken deep into these hallways, deep down below the surface. The worker will take you to a door further below than any other in the building, possibly even a hundred meters below the basement. This is where your last chance to turn back is. Should you decide to go into this door, your fate will be sealed, and there will be no chance of ever leaving alive. Turn back if you want to find other Objects. If not...Well, then ask the worker to unlock the door. He will beg you to leave, tears flowing over his cheeks, and he will scream at you if badgered enough. But he should give in if you are determined. He will open the door. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Enter, and it will be closed behind you, and locked. Now there is no turning back, and no matter what you do, you will eventually die. The beings creeping in the shadows of the room have already begun to leech your life from your body and you will feel older with every second. Run as fast as you can to the door on the other side of the room and enter it. The beings here are simply minor demons, not even capable of scaring the smallest child. Follow the red path you see and you will soon reach a wooden door. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Knock thrice. If you are lucky, someone will ask you to stay where you are. Your death will be a quick one. Should he instead tell you to enter, do so. Your feelings do not matter; nothing matters after you have entered this room. Here, you will see them, all behind a kind of force-field that repels anything that gets too close. You will see two thousand of them, precisely two thousand. Or rather: One thousand and nine-hundred and ninety-nine. The last of them is held by the person in the middle of the room. But you will also see things that cannot be described by human words. Things that show that this very room could be a tiny part of hell. Things that might drive you mad if you look at them for too long. Walk closer to the one in the middle, him, her, it. It does not matter what the being there is. Ask him: \"Why do you hide them?\". He will answer you. He will tell you how he got his first one and then proceeded to look for all those others you see around you. The tale might drive you mad, it might kill you, it could do anything to you. But in the case that nothing happens, he will ask you to take his Object. It is attached to his chest, but do not even come close to it. Tell him the following: \"I came to see, not to touch. You may now let me leave.\" \r\n<br>\r\n<br>He will then laugh. He will laugh even worse than the devil, more evil than anything in the world. He will then say a simple sentence. \"Your fate is sealed.\" The Object on his chest will begin to glow and you will feel pain. Then madness. And finally, death. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You have three choices here. One is to accept your fate, and descend to the lowest level of hell for eternity. The second is to kill him, promptly and speedily, but to do so is to take his place as the Holder of Legion, thus rendering your entire quest worthless. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>The third is to produce the first Object. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>If you do, he will scream and attempt to attack you. Do not worry- he can\'t get past the Object. Eventually he will begin to melt, as he dashes himself against the force field generated by the symbol of madness you hold in your hands. Do not open your eyes until no more sound is heard. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Toss the first Object away and look. Where the thing once stood, a single, gigantic diamond lies twinkling on the floor. Grab it. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>It will embed itself in your chest, becoming part of you as much as your heart or your brain. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>You are now the final Object of the 2538. Bring them together, and show us your smile. \r\n<br>');
